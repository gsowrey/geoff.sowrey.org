	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once in a while, someone notices you. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a pretty woman walking down the street. Sometimes it&#8217;s a friend you haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. And once in a while, it&#8217;s your entire company.<br />
This year, starting in our Town Hall meeting in June, Critical Mass decided to implement a kind of &#8220;employee of the month&#8221; award. It&#8217;s formally called the &#8220;Critical Mass Valuable Person&#8221;, or cMVP for short. The criteria for nomination are pretty straight-forward:<br />
(Taken from the nomination form)</p>
<ul>
<li>Exemplifies our values:</li>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Excellence &amp; Results</li>
<li>Teamwork &amp; Respect</li>
<li>Creativity &amp; Innovation</li>
<li>Leadership &amp; Accountability</li>
<li>Integrity &amp; Honesty</li>
</ul>
<li>Is technically superior in their job</li>
<li>Has a consistent, positive attitude towards clients, fellow project team members, fellow colleagues, their job and Critical Mass</li>
<li>Is reliable and conscientious in everyday tasks and job expectations</li>
<li>Strives to learn continuously on a personal level or by facilitating learning for others</li>
<li>Displays initiative by taking on projects outside of their job description</li>
<li>Shares ideas and contributes to best practices at a project, department or company level</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty high standards, if you ask me. And considering that the timeframe is (ideally) a month, that&#8217;s an awful lot of work to have to pull off for someone to take notice. I also cannot really see myself completely fulfilling some of these criteria. Take &#8220;technically superior&#8221;. It&#8217;s a little subjective. As a Web Developer, I&#8217;ll rate myself as, say, better than average. But technically superior? I can&#8217;t honestly agree to that &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of people here who can code circles around me.<br />
No-one who receives the cMVP knows about it going into the presentation. They&#8217;re just a face in the crowd, like everyone else. Where I was standing, I couldn&#8217;t hear much, aside from snippets of what this person was like. When I heard &#8220;takes pictures of all our events&#8221;, my heart stopped for a moment. I do that. It could be me. But then I dismissed it &#8212; Jude takes lots of pictures, and with everything he does, I&#8217;d expect him long before me.<br />
&#8220;This month&#8217;s cMVP is Geoff Sowrey.&#8221;<br />
I froze. Blood ran cold. Eyes bugged out.<br />
Me??<br />
Stunned. Pure stunned. Nothing more eloquent will ever fully describe the feeling of total shock I felt when I heard my name. I stood in place, people around me staring (and clapping, I think), for what seemed an eternity before I got myself to move. Thelton, our President and COO, the person giving out the award, couldn&#8217;t even see me from where I was standing.<br />
Ever since the cMVP was first announced, I had wished I could qualify for it. But there are a lot of people in this company deserving of such an award. They put in a lot of effort, sometimes for little more than a &#8220;thank you&#8221;. While my wildest dreams had me winning cMVP, my reality was quite content to nominate others and not worry about it.<br />
Winning the cMVP is like an Emmy or an Oscar. You&#8217;re nominated by your peers, although it&#8217;s the Executive who selects you. It&#8217;s the second-highest award you can win here. (The highest is the cMVP of the Year, which has yet to be given out.) That&#8217;s just fine with me &#8212; I&#8217;ll be flying quite high on this for a while, I think.<br />
So I find myself here, on a Monday that&#8217;s not going nearly as well as I&#8217;d have liked, typing away about something I won (I very much hesitate using the word &#8220;deserved&#8221;) with still-shaking hands. It&#8217;s an honour that I&#8217;ll have to live up to even more than I apparently already do.<br />
I don&#8217;t toot my own horn (at least too often). But I certainly won&#8217;t object to others tooting it for me.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Way back in early August, I learned the awful truth that Therese and Stuart were moving to Montreal, ne&#8217;er to return. (Okay, that&#8217;s an assumption. They might, but I ain&#8217;t holding my breath.)<br />
Needless to say, I suddenly ran into the problem of living in the big city of Calgary without any close friends. (Okay, that&#8217;s an exaggeration. I do have a fabulous roommate &#8212; say &#8220;hi&#8221;, Tamara!) Faced with a prolonged period of time (mostly) alone, I felt I needed something a little more.<br />
Now, my experience in this city has been one of dichotomy. While it appears to be full of young, single people, none of them appear to be women and even fewer seem to be interested in me. Given, I wasn&#8217;t trolling bars or clubs. That&#8217;s because the pickings in those places is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say that when you&#8217;re looking for Dom Perignon, y&#8217;ain&#8217;t about to settle for Baby Duck.<br />
This is what led me to (drum roll, please) the Internet.<br />
You: And here I thought you were going to say &#8220;train station&#8221;.<br />
Me: Ha ha&#8230;<br />
You: Though I suppose we shouldn&#8217;t be too surprised about the Internet, either.<br />
Me: Remember who you&#8217;re talking to.<br />
As was once quoted in the movie &#8220;American Pie&#8221;, God bless the Internet. You can find *anything* there. I mean it &#8212; look long enough, and you&#8217;ll eventually come across something that pretty much fits exactly what you need.<br />
This is how I found Erin.<br />
A couple years ago, I&#8217;d heard of a site called &#8220;Lavalife&#8221;. It&#8217;s a pseudo-dating site. I say &#8220;pseudo&#8221; because the site itself does nothing to set you up with anyone else. It&#8217;s solely for providing a place for people find each other. It&#8217;s up to the individual to contact someone else. What happens from there is up to you and your ability not to come across as a schmuck.<br />
And yes, somehow, I managed to do just that. (Or Erin is kind enough to overlook and not mention it.)<br />
We met online, under aliases, and exchanged email. (It shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising as a result that email constitutes the majority of our communication.) That led to online chatting (through MSN) and eventually to the (*gasp*) phone number exchange. It was still a while after that before we actually met for the first time.<br />
This is the great thing about using the Internet for dating, particularly on dating sites such as Lavalife: quality. (Okay, not entirely true. Erin&#8217;s told me a few horror stories of some of the guys she met online.) Generally-speaking, people who come to Lavalife have a similar goal: to meet someone else. You&#8217;re not dealing with pounding music, a smoky room, or people so fake that it&#8217;s actually painful. There&#8217;s no commitment, and there&#8217;s no requirement. It&#8217;s just you, a keyboard, and a digital photo of yourself (technically optional, but you&#8217;ll want one anyway).<br />
Somehow, all that managed to get me introduced to Erin, though I honestly can&#8217;t remember who made first contact. (Not that it really matters now.)<br />
So, what do you want to know about Erin? Well, she&#8217;s a little younger than I (if you think I&#8217;m giving out age, you&#8217;re definitely mistaken), a little shorter than me (which is not a big deal), but is big on conversation, movies, having a good time, and above all, getting to know people. We clicked on the first date, which either says a lot for me, or for Erin&#8217;s ability to see past all that freakishness that seems to scare everyone else away.<br />
One of the weirdest things, which we learned very early on in one of our phone calls, is that we work barely over a block from each other. Were it not for the Ribtor building, we&#8217;d probably be able to see each other&#8217;s workplace. Unfortunately, despite proximity, having mutual lunches is exceedingly difficult due to Erin&#8217;s schedule. Perhaps one day&#8230;<br />
So you could say that I have a new girlfriend. Well, sorta, anyway. For now, we&#8217;re sticking to just &#8220;seeing each other&#8221;. It&#8217;s not for a want of using something more definite, but just because we don&#8217;t want to rush things too much (we&#8217;re still firmly in &#8220;Discovery&#8221; mode). But I see no reason why I wouldn&#8217;t be calling Erin my girlfriend before too long.<br />
And this time, she&#8217;s not a 637,540 pound steam locomotive. (See [[Steam Train with CN 6060, Stettler to Big Valley]] for an explanation of that little joke.)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is nothing harder in life than saying goodbye to a loved one. This evening, I had to make the hardest choice of my life. This evening, I had to put my beloved Siamese cat to sleep. A year and a half and one day ago, my father passed away. Tonight, Spaz goes to join him, together again. They were inseparable while Dad was alive. It seems only fitting that they are now reunited.<br />
It is particularly hard to accept this, especially coming after yesterday&#8217;s high, remembering the first anniversary of the CBC 50th Anniversary Train. To come from a high to a low in such a period certainly does not help one&#8217;s happiness quotia. That&#8217;s probably why I&#8217;ve had too much to drink for one night, in a vain attempt to kill the pain.<br />
Spaz was born in either 1989 or 1991, depending on who you ask. I believe it is the former, but her medical records suggest the latter. She was a gift from my Aunt Ruth to my grandmother, who named her Yum-Yum, after one of the characters in Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&#8217;s &#8220;Mikado&#8221;. My grandmother wasn&#8217;t one for names, though, and soon was calling her &#8220;Puss&#8221;, as she had every other cat. I was the only one who called her &#8220;Spaz&#8221;, referring to her spastic behaviour as a kitten.<br />
Over the years, Spaz became an absolutely personable cat. She would immediately warm up to whomever was in the room, usually beelining for the person most allergic to her. She rarely bit anyone, and if she did it was because they weren&#8217;t giving her enough seafood. After Grandma moved into a retirement apartment, Dad took in Spaz, where they became fast friends. Spaz saw much of North America travelling with my parents. When Dad died last year, I took Spaz into my home, as Mom has never really been a huge fan of pets. Spaz and I enjoyed over a year together, sleeping in the same bed, often under the same covers.<br />
(I should note that when I spoke with Mom earlier this evening, she was almost as upset as I was. Mom might have not been a big fan of pets, but Spaz was such a great cat that she grew on everyone around her.)<br />
Over the last two months, I saw a change in Spaz, though I wasn&#8217;t fully willing to accept it. Mom was the one to finally bring it to light when she was out visiting. Spaz was underweight. She was not as responsive as in her glory. I think I refused to believe that perhaps the end was in sight.<br />
Yesterday, as Tamara and I returned from a matinee, I found Spaz coughing in a way I&#8217;d never seen her before, and spitting up material I&#8217;d never seen. Fearing the worst, I immediately took her to the Calgary North Animal Hospital (on a recommendation from Scott and Tara, whose cats have visited probably more times than they care to wish). Spaz was immediately admitted and almost immediately transferred to an oxygen tent. Blue at admitting, she was soon able to breathe.<br />
I waited in Exam Room 1 for the doctor, reading the poster for anatomy on ferrets. Outside, I could hear a boy, no more than five years old, crying desperately to his mother about never seeing his pet again. Inside, I felt like that five year old. Somehow, I knew that Spaz would never be coming home again.<br />
Over the next 18 hours, Spaz was checked, prodded, poked, and tested. At about 16:45, I received a call from Dr. Henderson, who began to explain to me the seriousness of Spaz&#8217;s condition. Although she didn&#8217;t say it outright, I knew what she was telling me. Spaz&#8217;s life was at an end, and there was likely little veterinary science could do to save her. I had known Spaz for almost half my life, and while I wasn&#8217;t willing to let her go, I wasn&#8217;t willing to let her suffer for my own selfish needs.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what exactly Spaz was suffering from, neither did Dr. Henderson. But suffering, she was. Blood tests were inconclusive, but Dr. Henderson was confident that the problems weren&#8217;t from asthma, which Spaz had dealt with for many years. This was far more serious. My conversation with the vet only seemed to conclude that tests would only show what would ultimately kill Spaz, not what could cure her.<br />
It was raining when Tamara and I drove up to the hospital. Spaz was in an incubator &#8212; the kind used for premature babies. She was warm, as I&#8217;d always hoped she&#8217;d be at the end. But she was unresponsive. She seemed to only vaguely know that we were there. There was no purring. Although she was lying upright (not on her side), she didn&#8217;t really respond the way she had less than two days before.<br />
We left the hospital, passing by the front clerk. She asked if we were sure that we didn&#8217;t want to be there with her. I barely choked out a &#8220;no, thanks&#8221; as we passed by. I nearly lost control twice on my way out the door. I couldn&#8217;t be there, although it broke my heart not to be with her at the end.<br />
It helped having Tamara with me as we drove home. Without her, I would not have been able to focus on the road. I was numb. When Dad passed away, I was saddened, but knew that his end was coming. Spaz&#8217;s death I was not prepared for, though I knew that by bringing her to Alberta, I might have only extended her life by a year. I just wasn&#8217;t ready for it.<br />
The best part about driving in the rain is that no-one can see you crying.<br />
Farewell, dear Spaz. May you, Dad, and Grandma be reunited again.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that it&#8217;s only been a year since the day the CBC Television 50th Anniversary VIA Rail Train departed Vancouver on its epic 33-day trip across Canada. It seems like it&#8217;s been a lot longer.<br />
I suppose part of that is because I live in Calgary, isolated from nearly everyone else on the trip. (Enza&#8217;s very close to me, living in Banff, but I don&#8217;t have the luxury of working in the same building, as most of the Toronto folk do.) I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to see a couple of people &#8212; Angela and Tracy when they stopped through on a documentary tour (see [[CBC documentaries at the Glenbow Museum]]), and Julie and Enza when Julie came out on a conference (we met in Banff). Beyond that, the only contact I&#8217;ve had is through email.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate saying goodbye to close friends. Early this morning, Therese and Stuart boarded their WestJet flight with a trunkful of luggage and two cats. They&#8217;re moving to Montreal. By about this time, they&#8217;re over Ontario, about an hour from landing in Ottawa.<br />
For the last three and a half years, I&#8217;ve had the luxury of living in a city with three of my closest friends. Chris lived with me for two of those years. But Chris moved to Japan, and while we do keep regular communication through email and ICQ, it&#8217;s just not the same as having him here. I didn&#8217;t see Stuart and Therese nearly as much as I would have liked, but having them in the same city was just somehow comforting.<br />
Now I feel almost alone. I have friends here, yes, but none like them. None with whom I have a great history. None where even just a simple hug can convey more words than a 100-page treatise on friendship. They&#8217;re more family than friend. I&#8217;ll see them again, of that there is no doubt, but it won&#8217;t be for at least a couple of weeks. (Both need to come back over the next two months, Stuart to get their belongings moved, and Therese for her dissertation.) After that, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess.<br />
On Saturday, I went to a small get-together for Stuart and Therese at Stephanie&#8217;s home. (Stephanie is Therese&#8217;s classmate and friend.) There were only about 10 people in attendance. I know them all, but hadn&#8217;t seen some in well over a year. We talked, ate, and played with Pepper, Stephanie and Ian&#8217;s Westhighland Terrier. Yet despite all the laughter and good humour, there was an underlying tension. Two people were leaving.<br />
I spent most of Sunday cleaning up around the house. I haven&#8217;t cleaned much this summer, owing to a busy schedule. Things are almost back to normal. It was a way for me to kill time until Therese and Stuart called. I had offered to take them out to dinner, but as with every major move I&#8217;ve ever seen, packing was still going on right until they called me at about 18:30, to help clean out Therese&#8217;s office.<br />
I felt strangely in the way as I helped move boxes of papers and books into the Jetta and the Mini. (If you think a Mini is small, just see what you can pack in one!) It took a couple of hours, but we made off with everything inside. Stuart and I would return later, having accidentally forgotten a poster in the computer lab (which led to a fairly tense time trying to remember the door code) and needing to drop off a guitar and a glass vase.<br />
Dropping Stuart off, I drove off into the night, with a single thought in my mind:<br />
Movement is life. Be it physical or existential, it is nonetheless important and necessary. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you are moving from one city to the next, or from one state of mind to the next, just so long as you move. You will only feel true pain if you stop moving.<br />
Good luck, and best hopes and wishes, my friends! Never stop moving.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last weekend was the first weekend in a while where a) I wasn&#8217;t busy with work or family, and b) wasn&#8217;t trying to paint the house. (No, I&#8217;m not done painting. I&#8217;m just sick of it.) So I opted to relax a little bit.<br />
It was raining when I awoke Saturday. This is something we&#8217;ve been dying to happen for a while now, if for nothing else than to hopefully take some of the smoke out of the air. We&#8217;ve been plagued by smoke from forest fires in the Crowsnest Pass for days now, and it&#8217;s long since past that point where campfire smoke actually smells good. So began my lazy Saturday. It felt sooooo good.<br />
I spent most of the day watching TV and movies, and fidding around with my computer. (It was cool enough that I could have the computer on for long periods without fear of overheating.) In the late afternoon, Stuart called to see what I was up to. Having no specific plans (outside of expecting my friend Greg to appear at some point during the day), we loosely planned for a movie that evening.<br />
We then talked about Stuart and Therese&#8217;s big move. Therese has accepted a post-doctorate at the University of Montreal. This led Stuart to fly out to Montreal and find a new job. Which took about 20 seconds. Stuart has far too much talent and experience for his own good, it seems, and pretty much could walk into almost any agency and get snapped up right away. A better job, a better town, and a lot more than I&#8217;m being paid. [Insert sound of swallowed pride here.]<br />
But it means they have to move at the beginning of September. Although I don&#8217;t get to see Therese and Stuart as much as I&#8217;d like, I&#8217;m about to see them even less. I haven&#8217;t seen some of my friends in well over five years. It won&#8217;t be easy having them half-way across the country.<br />
However, I might end up following them out. Critical Mass is currently engaged in the single largest pitch we&#8217;ve ever engaged in. The potential is massive, and could totally change the way Critical Mass operates. It&#8217;s exciting and terrifying at the same time, and no-one here really knows what will happen if we do win the work. (We&#8217;ve got stiff competition, so we honestly don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;ll fare.)<br />
One thing we do know is that we&#8217;ll have to reopen the Toronto office, for a variety of reasons. First, it&#8217;s closer to the client than Calgary. Second, we&#8217;ll have an easier time finding suitable people in the Toronto market &#8212; we&#8217;ve pretty much depleted Calgary&#8217;s. Third, we&#8217;ll need to keep the team separate from the one in Calgary, partly because we don&#8217;t want conflict with existing teams.<br />
The obvious question you know have is: Am I moving to Toronto? Maybe. And that&#8217;s about the best answer I can currently offer. I knew about this plan weeks ago when we were working on the pitch document (see 5 August 2003), and my name was on the list for the Toronto office. This is for a number of reasons, but mostly because Di (who&#8217;s leading this project) knows that when the going gets tough, I don&#8217;t leave the office.<br />
There&#8217;s another reason other than my workaholism. I&#8217;ve been personally unable to choose between staying here in Calgary or going to Toronto. I&#8217;ve done the southern Ontario thing, so that in itself isn&#8217;t a draw for me. But the opportunities that might present themselves might be work the risk (if there is in fact any risk). So I decided that I needed the company&#8217;s opinion on where they wanted me most. Since Monday, I&#8217;ve heard answers all across the board, and no clear direction. They definitely ain&#8217;t making this easy for me.<br />
That other reason? When I talked with Cory, he mentioned that we&#8217;re going to have a hard time getting our team up to speed as quickly as possible. He wanted to see someone with experience that he could throw to the wolves and know that they&#8217;d have them tamed in due course. Jude and Colin have either not expressed an interest to go, or have said flat out that they don&#8217;t want to go. That leaves me as the only other Web Development Manager. And since my name is on the list already, that&#8217;s just an added benefit.<br />
Cory doesn&#8217;t want to see me go there for two years, though (the desired contracted time for anyone transferring to Toronto). Frankly, neither do I. Somehow, I&#8217;ve become oddly useful to a number of people and projects here, which is why I was having problems decide. (Allard, my boss, had expressed his opinion that I should stay.) Cory and I are already thinking that a shorter term, say six months, might be more appropriate. Sort of like the infamous Dilbert Bungee Boss.<br />
We found out today that the client is delaying their decision a month, so the earliest I&#8217;d be going is late October. (Although I will be in Toronto Sept. 18-20 for a job fair to find candidates for the job. Anyone interested in a job at Critical Mass?) There&#8217;s no guarantees of anything, so we&#8217;ll have to wait and see what happens.<br />
I spent most of the weekend thinking about how to handle this decision, and most of this week trying to figure out what the company wants. (But given the sheer chaos going on around here this week &#8212; several other clients have asked for the world by next week &#8212; I can totally understand getting mixed messages.)<br />
Back to Saturday, though. Greg eventually did call, having arrived in Calgary later than planned owing to heavier traffic than expected and far too many people at the McDonald&#8217;s and Tim Horton&#8217;s along the way. I felt pretty bad, because we&#8217;d loosely planned to do something when he got there, but with Stuart and Therese leaving, I wanted to see them as much as possible. (I didn&#8217;t get to see Therese that night, since she had to continue writing her PhD dissertation.) Greg, it seemed, was pretty keen on seeing a movie.<br />
Stuart, Greg, and I shared a pre-movie beverage at Eau Claire before heading in. The movie (S.W.A.T.) wasn&#8217;t exactly Oscar material, but I&#8217;ve seen worse this year. Stuart headed out after the movie, leaving Greg and I to continue our chat at the Barley Mill. It&#8217;s been a long time since Greg and I last had a good talk &#8212; in fact, it was almost a year ago (see 1 September 2002).<br />
The following morning was my first run with dim sum in about two months. Scheduling&#8217;s been a pain, and my weekends have been so busy that it just hasn&#8217;t been possible. But this could have been my last with Stuart and Therese, so I wanted to make the most of it.<br />
Greg and I hooked up later that afternoon, and opted for a drive out of town. (Mostly because Greg wanted to see what the Mini was like.) After grabbing coffee (for Greg) at Tim Horton&#8217;s, we headed west out to Bragg Creek, and then down to Elbow Falls. I had kind of expected it to be like the last time I was there (see 3 July 2001, Part 1) &#8212; a few people, and quiet. Instead, the entire area was full of people picnicing and jumping off the cliffs into the splash pool below.<br />
We wandered around a bit, discussing jobs, politics, cars, families, girlfriends (well, his anyway), and pretty much anything else that came to mind. Then it was back to the road. But this time, Greg drove. Greg wanted to see what a Mini was like on the road, and I trust Greg implicitly. (Although he does drive a little faster than I do&#8230;)<br />
As we bombed down Highway 22 towards Calgary, something floated into Greg&#8217;s head: Fubar. No, not that he was about to total my car, but the movie. (It&#8217;s an independant cult-level movie filmed in Alberta. It&#8217;s on Greg&#8217;s &#8220;Top 10 Movies That Changed My Life&#8221; list, next to &#8220;Scarface&#8221;.) Part of the movie takes place in a little town called High River. When I told Greg it was maybe 50 kms south of Calgary, he nearly lost control of the car:<br />
Greg: (Excitedly) [Censored] it! We&#8217;re goin&#8217;! (More calmly) Uh, do you mind?<br />
Me: (Not really caring, or fully understanding the desire.) Uh, okay&#8230;<br />
Greg: (Excitedly) [Censored] it! We&#8217;re goin&#8217;!<br />
Before long, we were in High River, searching for a building with a mural of buffalo being chased off a cliff. (Don&#8217;t ask. If you haven&#8217;t seen the movie, it doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense. I know because I haven&#8217;t seen the movie, either.) Greg was beside himself when we finally found it (didn&#8217;t take long &#8212; High River&#8217;s not that big). One day I will finally understand was the excitement was all about.<br />
Buying what I can only constitute as a &#8220;ceremonial&#8221; cube of Pilsner (a &#8220;cube&#8221; is the Albertan equivalent of an Ontario 2-4), we returned to Calgary and a late dinner, with what I can only describe as the best roast beef I think I&#8217;ve ever had. My father would have loved it.<br />
We parted ways later that night, not having run out of conversation topics or energy, but time. I had work the following day (I missed going to the gym due to lack of energy and sleep) and Greg had to drive to Edmonton the following day.<br />
I went to bed that night with many things floating around in my mind, most of them about what I would do without old friends. Makes me wonder what the next few weeks are going to bring.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Despite the plethora of forest fires plaguing the B.C. interior, my family decided it was a good weekend to dive into the (mostly) green forests of Banff National Park.<br />
Now you&#8217;re probably wondering why on Earth I noted forest fires in B.C. when Banff National Park is clearly in Alberta. Simply put: smoke travels. Calgary has had many hazy days as a result of all the fires, and my eyes have itched a fair amount due to airborne particulates. As we left the city, you couldn&#8217;t see the Rockies in the distance. It will be like this until the forest fires end.<br />
I started off my morning slapping another coat of paint around the windows. I came inside to prepare for the excursion only to find Miao-Yin had decided to lay waste to my couch with the former contents of her stomach. After vigourously repressing the urge to use her as a furry soccer ball (I banned her to the basement for the next 24 hours instead), I cleaned up the mess, then cleaned myself and gathered my photography equipment, finishing just as my family arrived to pick me up.<br />
Uncle Mike drove with Nana riding shotgun. I sat behind Mike; Mom behind Nana. Aunt Brenda, Maggie, and Jen took up the rear of the minivan. With the A/C on full blast (or so it felt), we took off for the trip into the mountains.<br />
Our first stop (not counting the raid of Robin&#8217;s Donuts to get a snack for the ride out) was at the Three Sisters Mountain Village. This is a new development project up the mountain slopes on the south-eastern edge of Canmore. This is a massive project &#8212; the Three Sisters bought up 1,800 acres of land, and portioned them out into lots for fairly expensive homes (condos starting at $250,000 and homes starting at around $400,000) to homes starting at 4,500 square feet (I don&#8217;t want to know the price). Naturally, the area is pockmarked with golf courses.<br />
The development is mostly to cater to those who want to live the Banff lifestyle, but can&#8217;t move into Banff (which has a limitation on development). While Canmore doesn&#8217;t lie within the boundaries of Banff National Park, the city council seems to have kept the general ideas in place. Canmore has yet to acquire a real &#8220;mall&#8221; of any kind.<br />
Sighing off the prices that none of us can (or will ever) afford, we proceeded to Banff. Or more specifically, to the line-up for Banff. Despite the haze brought on by forest fire smoke, a large number of Albertans and tourists alike were gathered at the park entrance to acquire their day passes. So naturally, we ended up in the slowest line.<br />
Mike and Brenda decided to renew their annual pass, and made quick work of the purchase. About a half hour after entering the line, we were pulling off for the Minnewanka Loop. The Minnewanka Loop is a road on the north side of the Trans-Canada Highway, across from Banff Townsite. The road is a several-kilometre loop up to Lake Minnewanka, across the retention dam, and eventually back around to the road you went up in the first place. It&#8217;s a nice ride, albeit curvy.<br />
Our first stop was at Lake Minnewanka, where we took a few moments to make use of facilities and take a look around. It&#8217;s a gorgeous little area &#8212; you can even take power and sailboats up there for a cruise around the lake. It&#8217;s a fairly large lake, too, so there&#8217;s a lot to see on water that you would have some trouble getting to on land.<br />
Some of the surrounding hills showed sign of forest fire. To keep Banff National Park (and other surrounding areas), conservationists started controlled fires to burn out some of the material most likely to burn. It&#8217;s a little unsightly, but helps with the forest life cycle and promotes new, healthy growth.<br />
One thing that&#8217;s been discovered in recent years is that, despite the obvious damage, forest fires are a necessary part of life in the forest. New growth can&#8217;t start in old growth forests. Although environmentalists cry out at the thought of burning an old forest (can&#8217;t say I blame &#8217;em, either), the canopies are often too dense to let light in to spur new trees. When the forests burn, the canopies are destroyed and nutrients (in the form of ash) are returned to the soil. Though it takes a few years, the resulting forest is just as strong and healthy as the previous one.<br />
As an additional note: logging does not appear to have the same benefits as burning.<br />
Anyway, we didn&#8217;t stick around too long at Minnewanka, as there was a severe lack of picnic tables. So we decided to head on down to Johnson Lake, in hopes of something there. The road was mostly empty, save for the odd car. Normally, the area would be full of campers. An influx of grizzly bears has put a stop to that for now.<br />
Johnson Lake was slowly beginning to fill up. We arrived early enough, however, to acquire a picnic table in the shade. Considering that it was quite warm outside, this was a definite benefit &#8230; the breeze that blew in off the lake also helped.<br />
The portable propane barbecue was set up (open fires are pretty much verboten throughout Western Canada at the moment) and lunch started while Jen and I went for a little wander around the area. The next time I go back, I&#8217;ll have to make sure to wear shoes (I was wearing sandals) and return when all the trails are reopened (closed either for safety reasons, specifically bears, or for environmental protection).<br />
The six of us sat under the trees, fending off the odd bee and trying to keep Maggie from barking at everyone or eating out of our hands. Aside from the nigh-indestructable table, the experience was pretty much prototypical picnic.<br />
Following our lunch (the table was open for all of 10 seconds before another family swooped in on it), we headed out for Banff Townsite. Like the picnic area we had just left, Banff (Bamf!) was full of people and cars. (Although we managed to get a parking spot on Banff Ave.) Such was to begin our afternoon of shopping.<br />
There&#8217;s only one thing that will truly keep me from shopping: other people. And I&#8217;m not referring to too many other people &#8212; shopping in crowded malls (especially during Christmas) has always been a fun thing to do. The problem wasn&#8217;t mine, so much as it was Nana&#8217;s and Mom&#8217;s. They&#8217;re not exactly the Andretti brothers when it comes to walking down crowded sidewalks. And with the heat, Mom&#8217;s mobility wasn&#8217;t exactly stellar.<br />
Much to Jen&#8217;s dismay, we made it only down one side of the street before calling off the shopping spree. Nana was the only purchaser. We had debated on going to the Banff Springs for a drink on the patio. Then it was the Rose and Crown in Canmore, as there would be far less tourists there. But as we approached Canmore, we decided it was better to have drinks in Calgary.<br />
I fell asleep on the way home. I guess I&#8217;d had too much mountain air for one day. (And I had woken early to tackle some house painting.) I snapped out of my slumber at the Calgary city limits.<br />
That night, my family feasted on Thai from the King and I. What amazed me, at first anyway, was that Mom was keen on trying it. But somehow, it hadn&#8217;t registered with her that &#8220;Thai&#8221; was Asian. And Mom&#8217;s not a big fan of Asian foods. She did eat some of it, though.<br />
That was my Saturday. I can sum up Sunday in one word: Painting.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The weekend past was the August long weekend. Well, it was the long weekend for most people. For me, it was one of three things: painting the house, spending time with family, or being at work.<br />
Four things, if you count sleeping.<br />
Mom arrived in town Wednesday afternoon. Her arrival was what had fuelled my desire to paint the house. The idea was to have the whole thing painted in time for her arrival. Yeah, my ambition&#8217;s pretty sizeable. I figure: Go big, or go home. I might have made it, had it not been for a couple of work-related things that came up and threw me off-target for time.<br />
Wednesday night I spent with Mom, Aunt Brenda, and my cousin Jen. Thursday night was here at the office, dealing with project work. For the first time since I started doing overtime at Critical Mass (on my second day on the job &#8212; see [[My First Entry from Critical Mass]]), I wasn&#8217;t programming. I was doing the things I used to do before I came to Critical Mass: document editing and formatting (and a little writing and editing).<br />
What was I working on? We&#8217;re doing the single largest pitch in the history of Critical Mass. And I can&#8217;t tell you who it&#8217;s for, so don&#8217;t ask. All I can tell you is that if we do win it, the contract will fundamentally change Critical Mass. It&#8217;s that big.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Aren&#8217;t I Mercedes-Benz Boy? I&#8217;m still working on our single largest account, no worries about that. But it&#8217;s been a slow year for us, and I had the opportunity to contribute. I also offered to assist with the document construction.<br />
Why did I do that? Well, for those of you who know what I used to do, it&#8217;s probably a bit of a surprise. For those of you who don&#8217;t, allow me to tell you why I&#8217;m a web developer. After graduating university, I became a Technical Writer (something I&#8217;d started doing on co-op work terms). I did technical writing for six years in total. Towards the end, I hated it so much I sometimes felt like a coyote caught in a trap, and wanted to gnaw my own hands off.<br />
While at Radical Entertainment, I started pushing myself more towards web development. I&#8217;d already been doing it for a number of years, so it wasn&#8217;t that big a stretch. Owing to a need to leave Vancouver, I came here. Based on a recommendation from my friend Scott, I applied at Critical Mass and the rest is history. But what isn&#8217;t commonly known is that while I was waiting for word from Critical Mass about my position, I was actively avoiding several technical writing positions.<br />
That&#8217;s how much this pitch means to Critical Mass. That&#8217;s how much I was driven to go back to doing what I used to do. That&#8217;s how I ended up in the office on Thursday night, most of Saturday, and all of Monday (8:00 to well after 22:00).<br />
That&#8217;s how I remembered how much I hate Microsoft Word.<br />
Friday night was the first of what will likely be many family dinners while Mom is out visiting. (Not that I&#8217;m complaining in any way.) But it was Saturday that was the big event &#8212; the birthday party for my Aunt Brenda. I won&#8217;t tell you how old she is, but it&#8217;s the one that causes people to put 50 pink flamingos on your front lawn.<br />
It was supposed to be a surprise party. It was supposed to be a grand little affair where we get her to scream in delight, etc. But I seem the only living person in my family able to organize these things without the guests of honour finding out. Aunt Brenda almost planned her entire party. Were it not for me being a royal pain-the-ass, she would have spent a good portion of it in the kitchen preparing food. I started banning her from the kitchen.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t easy, either. Aunt Brenda&#8217;s kitchen is a magnet for her. Every time I turned my back, she was back in there. I actually uttered: &#8220;Don&#8217;t make me come in there!&#8221;<br />
She did.<br />
I ended up finally kicking her out and handling the things she would have done, like making the best darn corn bread on the planet. It&#8217;s a heart attack in a pan, but it&#8217;s worth the potential coronary. I have *got* to get that recipe one of these days.<br />
The next day, I woke up a little early (for a weekend) to resume painting. It&#8217;s finally cooled off a bit, and it allowed me to tackle painting the front of the house &#8212; the only side I wanted to do before Mom saw the house. (I still have to do the west wall, but you can&#8217;t see it unless you&#8217;re in my neighbour&#8217;s yard.) I even got several of the windows finished up.<br />
Painting a house can be a bit of a Zen thing. (&#8220;Zen and the Art of Decorative Trim&#8221;?) I&#8217;ve had several people tell me that it might be great to have tunes blaring while slapping down a coat of paint. I have yet to have a radio turned on. And when I&#8217;m using the paint sprayer, I can&#8217;t hear anything else.<br />
House painting, in some ways, returns you to your youth. Especially when you use latex paints. It doesn&#8217;t stick to glass, plastic, or skin. It makes you feel like that creepy kid in second grade who put Elmer&#8217;s Glue all over their hands so they could peel it off like a layer of skin. It&#8217;s especially fun in the shower. Doesn&#8217;t matter how dried the paint is &#8212; a little warm water and soap, and *poof* there&#8217;s a clump of sloughed-off paint skin on the shower floor.<br />
Mom, Aunt Brenda, and Jen appeared around 14:00. Mom was being dropped off while the other two checked out &#8220;Johnny English&#8221;. Mom, Tamara and I chatted in the backyard for a while, listening to some jerk across the alley scream his head off at another tenant about unpaid bills and broken windows. It was an argument I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in listening to, but had little choice.<br />
Mom half-guilted me into cleaning up the yard a bit while we sat out back. Mostly cutting back all the suckers growing from two trees and the lilac bush. Admittedly, though, it did look better. Then it was back to painting.<br />
As Sunday was Aunt Brenda&#8217;s actual birthday, we all went out for dinner at a nice homey Italian restaurant along 17th Ave., Buon Giorno. Definitely not the swankiest restaurant in Calgary, but they make a good meal. Try the scallops &#8212; their chef cooks them to absolute perfection.<br />
My cell phone rang at 7:33 Monday morning. It was Chicago. Although I&#8217;d been on call all weekend, this was *the* call I&#8217;d been expecting. I was in the office 10 minutes later and editing. I had hoped to paint that morning. No matter. The worst that would happen was I&#8217;d be editing until 16:00, at which time the documents were off to Kinko&#8217;s for copying.<br />
Or at least that&#8217;s what I thought.<br />
The morning was sheer chaos and panic, especially when I saw the state of the appendix. It would take a phone call with Heather to put my mind at ease, especially when I realized that not everything in the appendix was supposed to be formatted.<br />
More problems with Word trying to do things I didn&#8217;t want it to do. These are problems that Microsoft has never removed. And before you go saying: &#8220;Must be a problem with the user&#8221;, when I first detected them with Word 97, I stumped the tech support guys in Redmond, WA who were unable to solve the problem. You&#8217;d think after six years, they&#8217;d fix the damn thing.<br />
Final call came sometime after 22:00 last night. I was tired. I hadn&#8217;t felt that tired as a result of office work in a very long time. But the pitch is off to the hopeful client-to-be. Now we just have to wait a half a month to find out if they want to take us to the second round or not. I hope there&#8217;s not as much pressure as the first round.<br />
My idea of pressure on the second round is the kind sealed by bottle cap.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I need a weekend from my weekend. &#8216;Course, it&#8217;s my fault for trying to do so much at once.<br />
For the last couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve been preparing to paint my house. (The outside, that is.) I should have painted it last year, as my home inspector suggested (see [[Meeting with the Home Inspector]]), but I had a few things that kinda got in the way ([[Moving into my New (Old) House|moving into the house]], [[My Housewarming Party|my housewarming party]], [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding|a wedding]], and the <a href="/index.php/category/cbc-tv-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">CBC 50th Anniversary train</a>). By the time I could have done it, the weather was too cold.<br />
Once the roof was reshingled (an expensive but necessary repair), I set down to start painting. I didn&#8217;t have to strip all the paint off, but I did have to remove paint from around the windows and the front door. Most of it had disintegrated and really needed to be replaced. The rest I can paint over.<br />
Weather and a few too many activities last week delayed my start, which I pegged as Saturday. However, I had forgotten about one little detail: I&#8217;d already promised to help my friends Fritz and Jin move into their new condo.<br />
This, I might add, I was more than happy to do. Fritz had helped me move last year ([[Moving into my New (Old) House]]), so this was my turn. Luckily, Fritz didn&#8217;t have anything truly awkward (except maybe the futon), so it was just a matter of hauling things around. There were five of us actually moving things: Fritz, Doug, Adrian, Godfrey, and myself. Jin was still frantically packing when I arrived just after 9:00.<br />
Fritz appeared minutes after me, carrying breakfast. (Had I known, I wouldn&#8217;t have hit Tim Horton&#8217;s before coming over.) Scarfing down a sausage McMuffin and a hashbrown, we proceeded to cart down boxes, tables, cabinets, beds (in pieces, of course), sheets of glass (from the tables), chairs, bags of who-knows-what, candlesticks (big ones), lights, paintings &#8230; we wouldn&#8217;t taken the doors, the toilet, and the kitchen sink if we could have gotten away with them.<br />
The hardest part of moving is going out. Because everything is spread out, it&#8217;s hard to gauge how much room they&#8217;ll take in the truck. Although Fritz had rented a medium-sized U-Haul, it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear how well everything would fit. Having moved too many times for my own good, I was confident that we&#8217;d get everything there in one trip.<br />
Slowly, but sure, the truck began to fill up. Godfrey had brought his pick-up truck, which would end up carrying a spare bed and a bicycle. Adrian&#8217;s Golf carried the TV and the computer. My Mini carried the glass from the tables. The truck was filled quite well, but far from capacity. We could have quite easily packed in many more things, but ultimately there was no need for such efficiency. Besides, Fritz and Jin don&#8217;t have that much stuff.<br />
(In fact, that ended up being a debate: who had more stuff in their move? Tamara and myself, or Fritz and Jin? We couldn&#8217;t decide.)<br />
The new condo is quite literally that &#8212; new. In fact, it&#8217;s still being finished. The condo was supposed to be ready last year. An accident set off one of the largest fires seen in Calgary, destroying most of the complex, and damaging a few units that had been finished years earlier. (Critical Mass&#8217; HR director fled home when she found out to save her cat. Luckily, her unit was spared damage.)<br />
The smell of fresh paint, carpet adhesive, and fresh-cut wood permeated the air. Banging could be heard from nearly every direction. (The crews have been working non-stop to finish the condos.) Our first obstacle was finding a place to park &#8212; the streets around Fritz and Jin&#8217;s condo were littered with construction vehicles. We ended up in a no-park zone.<br />
Next obstacle: stairs. There were no ramps, no direct access to the lobby. The architects weren&#8217;t particularly bright on that point, in my opinion. Lucky, nothing was particularly heavy. All we had to do was reverse the process (significantly easier) and move everything into the condo.<br />
Unpacking the trucks and cars would have taken less time than packing, were it not for the stairs and an elevator that were &#8220;in the way&#8221;. But even with that and Godfrey&#8217;s early departure, we still finished the move in about four hours. There was only one causality, a floor lamp that appeared to have had the threads stripped from one of its joints. (The lamp still works.)<br />
The move over, Fritz returned the U-Haul, and we headed over to Fujiyama for a post-move meal. Adrian, Doug, Fritz and Jin would return to the condo to sort out the contents. I, however, had a house to paint. Or more specifically, needed to get supplies with which to paint.<br />
Luckily, I knew what I wanted. Basic white paint, a can of green for accents, a couple of brushes, and a paint gun. Yeah, I know &#8212; what do I really need a paint gun for? Why not use brushes, right? Well, considering the amount of painting that I&#8217;ll need to do on a (semi-)regular basis, I think the cost of the paint gun will far outweigh the time I&#8217;d have to spend painting by hand. And it&#8217;ll save wrist strain.<br />
One other thing that I needed to get, which I determined after an inability to borrow one from someone, was a power washer. Every single site I read and every person I talked to said that I had to wash my house before applying the paint, otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t stick as well. Trips to Wal-Mart and Canadian Tire revealed models running from $129 to over $800. I settled for a little 1200 PSI Karcher.<br />
Rent? Oh yeah, I could have definitely rented both. But I&#8217;d have paid for it in the long run. The paint gun would have run me up quickly, to the point where I&#8217;d have paid more for renting than for owning. As for the power washer, the only rentals were gas-powered monsters that could strip not only the paint but probably some of the wood. (For the record, 1200 PSI is *plenty* for washing dirt, etc. from a house.)<br />
Changing into my painting clothes, I set about to wash down the house and prepare to start painting the next day. For the next three or so hours, I proceeded to get very wet and very dirty. I had paint chips, dirt, insect carcases, water (of course), and Heaven-knows-what-else rain down on me as I removed all the gunk the house has been collecting since the last time someone took the time to do the job. I&#8217;m reasonably certain it wasn&#8217;t the last owner.<br />
With the house dripping wet, there was nothing I could do until the next morning. Tired from a day of moving and cleaning, I opted for a steak dinner. On my way to the store, I felt the need to obtain a cold beverage with which to relax. Imagine my shock and delight when, wedged next to Sleeman&#8217;s Honey Brown, I found the long-missed lime-green packaging of Steam Whistle Pilsner. Life was definitely getting better.<br />
Originally planning to rise at 8:00, I evicted myself from bed around 9:00, opting for an extra hour of rest. Saturday still had me worn out, and I had a long day ahead of me.<br />
Task #1: Read the instructions for the paint gun. The last thing I want to do is screw the thing up. With the early morning, it was an ideal time to try and paint a portion of the house not easily seen &#8212; the north cupola (containing the bathroom) wall. This requires me to climb onto the roof on my fancy-schmancy ladder. (It bends in three places to help me do just what I was trying to do.)<br />
This is when I found out just how steep my roof is, and how there was no way I would have been able to reshingle the roof on my own. In fact, the roof is so steep that I couldn&#8217;t even climb off the ladder (which bent onto the roof) and climb up on my own. The shingles don&#8217;t help &#8212; they&#8217;re flat so there&#8217;s no grit on which to gain a foothold. I only managed to paint part of the small wall. As it was more a test than a task, I didn&#8217;t mind too much.<br />
As a result of my resounding non-success, I realized that I needed a paint roller to reach the more inaccessible areas. Either that, or mountaineering gear so I could climb up the side of my roof. Either, I resolved to paint the rest later.<br />
The rising sun prevented me from tackling the rear or east walls. (I&#8217;m leaving the west wall for sometime later, when there&#8217;s less pressure. You can&#8217;t see it unless you go into my neighbour&#8217;s yard, anyway.) I wasn&#8217;t too keen on doing the front of the house until I had a little more practice with the gun. I decided to give the stripped windows their first shot of green paint.<br />
About 11:30, I broke for a shower. Nana had invited me to the grand opening of her condo complex in the north end of town, and I wasn&#8217;t about to show up looking like I&#8217;d just done battle against a flock of birds with the runs.<br />
Nana lives in a retirement complex. Basically, an apartment building for people with not as much mobility as they once had. The amenities include a cafeteria (with pretty decent food, I&#8217;m told), nice views of a small man-made lake, exercise room, library, theatre (and a darn nice one, at that), and a wonderful little courtyard. The complex is next to a new strip-mall that has an IGA, various little shops, and 17 food service establishments.<br />
Nana fed me lunch. It was supposed to be a BLT, but I don&#8217;t like raw T. In fact, I can&#8217;t stand &#8217;em. I can eat T any other way, just not raw. So I had a BLC (cheese). It was still yummy.<br />
The party started around 13:00, and we hung around for about 45 minutes. It seemed to be little more than just a gathering. There seemed to be no official announcements, or greetings, or ceremony of any kind. Nana opted to give me the guided tour of the facilities in lieu of waiting around for something that didn&#8217;t seem to be happening.<br />
We ended up at the balcony at the end of her hallway, just down from her apartment. The balcony looks north across the lake. It&#8217;s a wonderful view, even if it is towards another complex being built on the north side of the lake. We sat and talked for almost an hour before I took my leave to resume my house painting.<br />
But I didn&#8217;t go right home &#8212; I made a stop by Revy to pick up the paint roller, tray, and an extension so I could reach those hard-to-reach places. I didn&#8217;t even get in the main entrance when my cell phone rang. It was my friend (and realtor) Robyn. Robyn has taken it upon herself (bless the woman) to be a matchmaker, and I&#8217;m her latest project.<br />
It was a set-up. I knew it was. Just like Thursday night, when we&#8217;d met for drinks down at the Barley Mill. Unlike that time, however, plans were fairly definite: a movie at 19:05 where I&#8217;d meet Robyn&#8217;s mysterious woman. (We have talked on the phone &#8212; an impromptu Robyn set-up, when we were at the pub.) Although it was a movie I&#8217;d already seen, I figured that I&#8217;d like to meet this woman, I could stand to get out for a while, and besides &#8212; &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; is actually a pretty good movie.<br />
Back at the ranch, I unpacked my newly-gotten booty, and got on with the show. The east wall was now in the shade, leaving me to start painting. I opted for the middle third of the wall, which is the section the cupola runs off of. The rollers helped me get the very top, which even my rather-long step ladder can&#8217;t reach. Of course, I got almost as much paint on me as I did on the wall and overhang.<br />
Reaching the level, it was time for me to change and prepare for the movie. (Note: I do not use the word &#8220;date&#8221;. It was a group event, as to remove any pressure.) Just as I was about to walk out the door for the trip up, my phone rang. It was Robyn. It appeared that my mystery woman had developed car trouble, and had decided not to go. This pretty much eliminated my desire to go out, since I could finish more painting.<br />
When I explained to Robyn that I&#8217;d rather paint, she was disappointed. But when I mentioned that I&#8217;d already seen the movie, she squealed in delight. I was willing to go see a movie I&#8217;d already seen just so I could meet a girl! I suddenly felt like I was in high school again. (Of course, this sort of thing *never* happened to me in high school.)<br />
Back into my painting gear, I tackled the rest of the east wall, and slid around to the east side of the south wall. I shut down the paint gun for the night after that. Although very fast, it&#8217;s quiet noisy and would probably bother my neighbours. I opted to give the windows a second coat of green, and apply a first coat to the window sills on the east wall.<br />
The sunlight gone along with the remainder of my energy, I went for a late dinner. I already knew that today was going to be rough. My arms are sore (from holding a fully-extended paint roller at a distance), my feet are killing me (standing on ladders), and I&#8217;ve got paint edged under every fingernail.<br />
And I&#8217;ve still got about 3/4 of a house to paint.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve often heard it said that there&#8217;s nothing like the sound of pitter-pattering around your home. This weekend, I found that sometimes this sound isn&#8217;t so nice. Like when your hot water heater is leaking.<br />
I noticed it in the early afternoon on Saturday, shortly after the third load of laundry had finished in the washer. There was a hissing noise emanating from the basement. I assumed at first that this was from the heater reheating. But the noise didn&#8217;t stop.<br />
Further inspection &#8212; actually *looking* at the heater &#8212; revealed hot water leaking from the relief valve. This was the first time I actually had a mild panic as a homeowner. How the hell could I stop/fix this? I knew a little of hot water heaters, but not enough to fix one. Luckily for me, my sister married an original Mr. Fix-It.<br />
A phone call to Ontario found my sister and brother-in-law in the glow of having just finished the installation of their kitchen skylight. Cathy was a tad surprised to hear me ask for Craig. (Usually, it&#8217;s the other way around.) Craig gave me a few ideas as what to do, and some ideas of maintenance. The first step: hook up a garden hose and purge the tank. While purging, open the valve a couple of times and clean it out.<br />
The relief valve on a hot water tank is a very simple (but very vital) piece of equipment. A hot water tank runs at about 150 psi. While that doesn&#8217;t sound like much, if a hot water tank were to explode at that pressure, you could say good-bye to your house and everything in it. That&#8217;s what the relief valve is for. It&#8217;s set to open at 150 psi and bleed off excess pressure before something nasty happens.<br />
Except mine was just open. After purging the tank, the leak was even worse. Another call to Ontario. This time, I removed the valve from the tank. That&#8217;s when I found the culprit of all my problems. Although I can&#8217;t tell for sure, the inside of my tank seems to be lined with about a half inch of calcium deposits. If ever there was an advertisment for water softeners, this is it. The temperature probe on the valve was so encrusted, and I had to pull quite hard to get it out.<br />
Thus began my repair project: immersing in a glass full of CLR and trying to get the thing to work properly. My grandiose plans for hitting the gym and getting in a little exercise before events in the evening were rapidly going to pot. By 19:00, the best I&#8217;d been able to do is a slight (but still noticeable) leak. And that was with a lower temperature. At least I could have a shower.<br />
I left for a party hosted by Chrissie, a fellow co-worker, around 21:00 &#8212; the valve returned to its CLR bath for the next 15 hours.<br />
While we wait for the valve to soak, let me tell you about this party. Chrissie, a long-standing CM employee, wanted to throw a &#8220;nothing to do with Stampede&#8221; party. For those of you not in the know, we&#8217;re currently immersed in the Calgary Stampede, which means the invasion of this city by every cowboy wannabe in the world for two weeks of &#8230; well, probably the best explanation is drunken stupidity. I&#8217;m really glad I no longer live right downtown.<br />
Held in the southeast quadrant of town, Chrissie is in an area that I had previously thought I wouldn&#8217;t want to live in. But her house was gorgeous &#8212; owned and renovated over a few months by Capri and Jason (other co-workers). They&#8217;d done it mostly for fun. (Yes, they&#8217;re both crazy.) It made for a great party venue.<br />
The soiree had a fairly healthy cross-section of the company, new to veteran, programmer to artist. And three DJs (two of whom are on my WebDev team) who kept the tunes running for the next few hours. There were about 60 people there, though it was hard to get an accurate count &#8212; people kept coming and going all night.<br />
One of the key reasons was to jointly celebrate Cory and Laura&#8217;s birthdays (both on Sunday). And hey, like we really need a good excuse to get together and have fun. The trick is just to avoid talking about work.<br />
Shawn came out, too. It was good to see him again. Shawn&#8217;s been on leave for a couple of months, and we&#8217;re really looking forward to his return at the end of the month. It&#8217;s just been too quiet without him around.<br />
I value Shawn&#8217;s opinion, mostly because he&#8217;s about as genuine as they come. Towards the end of the evening, Shawn and I were talking on the couch, when he mentioned that it was good to see &#8220;the Old Sowrey&#8221; again. I was a tad confused at first. I know I&#8217;m among the older folk in the WebDev group, but I didn&#8217;t realize I&#8217;d become the &#8220;Old Sowrey&#8221;. But Shawn qualified this by adding that the &#8220;New Sowrey&#8221; had worried him.<br />
Basically, Shawn had remembered what I was like in my first year and a half here. I was loud, obnoxious, and apparently a lot more fun. In the last year, I&#8217;ve become much more business-oriented, more focussed, and apparently a lot less fun. The thing is &#8212; I agreed with Shawn&#8217;s assessment. My ambition to rise in the ranks had led me to reforming myself to be more &#8220;appealing&#8221; to those who would promote me. I succeeded (far more than I thought possible) in that aspect, but inadvertantly led me to failing in another.<br />
The team dynamic is everything. No-one gets into the WebDev group unless they&#8217;ve got the attitude to go along with the skill. It was that attitude that I&#8217;d slowly been killing over the last year. I&#8217;ve actually become *too* professional.<br />
Before you start objection with this analysis, I&#8217;ll point out that this was not some snap decision. This was a bit of a revelation (even if it was someone pointing out the obvious), and I did spend some time truly thinking about it. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m going to have to keep an eye on. I want to be a professional, but the last thing I want to do is have that get in the way of having fun with my teammates.<br />
We left the party around 04:00. We knew we were ready when Cory just upped and walked out the front door. I&#8217;d stopped drinking about two hours earlier, knowing that I&#8217;d be driving people home. Originally it was just Shawn. But Candace abandoned Cory at the party, meaning he&#8217;d need a lift home. And Reid, who&#8217;d somehow managed to hang out that long, asked for a ride since he wasn&#8217;t far from Cory&#8217;s place.<br />
The ride back to Cory&#8217;s was fairly quick, though he lives at the south-west edge of town. At four in the morning, most of the intersection lights are blinking (amber on the main thoroughfare, red on the minor ones) &#8212; only major intersections have their lights still in normal operation. Which was good for Cory.<br />
We hit our only red light when we got to Southland and MacLeod. Cory, sitting in the front passenger seat, nonchalantly turned and opened the door. At first, I thought he was going to get out. (Cory was still quite loaded at this point, and I&#8217;ve seen drunks do weird things at early hours of the morning.) Cory leaned over, but not to get out of the car. He cursed me later for taking so long to stop at a light.<br />
As Shawn and I returned to downtown (Shawn lives not too far from my house), we noted that the sun was taking an awfully long time to set. It was then we realized that it was so late that it was early. Already, I knew that my sleeping schedule was going to be really screwed up for the next couple of days.<br />
Meanwhile, back at the hot water heater&#8230;<br />
Awaking around 13:00 (having gone back to bed after Jim called me at 10:15 to play disc golf, which I sleepily refused), I returned to the hot water tank problem. The valve had sat in CLR all night, and was glistening clean &#8212; no more rust or calcium. Figuring this was good, I taped it up and slapped it back in. A couple small drips.<br />
Fixed, right? Wrong. There shouldn&#8217;t be any drips. So it was off to Revy to get a new valve, and some piping for a drain pipe (the previous owner didn&#8217;t have one). Luckily, this stuff is so standard it was almost ridiculous how fast I picked up the valve, a 3/4&#8243; adapter (for the pipe), a connector, a three-foot section of copper tubing, and a plumbing soldering kit (I didn&#8217;t have one yet, and it was as good an excuse as any to get one).<br />
Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t purchase the valve with the intent to replace it right away. Actually, I had hoped the dripping would stop while I was gone. I might have been able to deal with a periodic drip, but when I raised the temperature to its normal setting, gushing water sealed the fate of the valve. It had to go.<br />
Luckily, my father had taught me how to install plumbing when I was a kid. I&#8217;m no expert, but I can handle most of the simple stuff. Probably couldn&#8217;t do a home improvement show, but as far as a pressure relief valves go, I&#8217;m good as gold. All I have to do now is sit back and wait to see what will go wrong next.<br />
My bet&#8217;s on the furnace&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Canada Day, most people take the time to go do something special, like visit events in their local community or town, possibly visit one of Canada&#8217;s majestic national parks (which are free today), or visit the local taverns and have one of Canada&#8217;s national beverages with friends.<br />
Me? I hang around with trains.<br />
Okay, before everyone gets all over me for doing &#8220;the train thing&#8221; again, I have to say that this is for the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, not me. Given the choice, I&#8217;d probably have hung out in and around the just-reopened Prince&#8217;s Island Park for the day. I probably would have avoided the killer sunburn I managed to get on my face. (You&#8217;d think that since I planned ahead and brought sunblock that I&#8217;d use it. Shows how much you know!)<br />
Every year on Canada Day, the Rocky Mountain Rail Society (I&#8217;m going to write &#8220;RMRS&#8221; from herein &#8212; it&#8217;s a long name to type) puts on a &#8220;show&#8221;. It&#8217;s not really a show, but a chance for us to connect with some of the local enthusiasts, show off some of our equipment (the &#8220;Eagle Springs&#8221; combine car &#8212; no, not the farm type, a beautiful 1930&#8217;s passenger car, and our Alco S-3 diesel. This stuff usually just sits in Calgary because we can&#8217;t normally do anything with it. But on Canada Day, not only do people get to see this stuff, but they get to ride it, too.<br />
Starting last year, Don managed to get us into the old CP Ogden Shops (now the Alstom Shops) to hold our show. It&#8217;s very handy, since that&#8217;s where our equipment is being stored here in Calgary. It&#8217;s also convenient, since there&#8217;s a plethora of rail equipment from multiple owners all over the massive complex.<br />
We&#8217;d been out twice before Canada Day, getting things ready. Last Wednesday, it was vacuuming the cars and general clean-up. Yesterday, it was preparing the display and getting things roughly set up. And making a few repairs to CP&#8217;s display cars (graciously donated for the day so there was more than just our stuff around) &#8212; during switching, someone had flattened the railing needed to hook the stairs to get in. Nothing a blowtorch, sledgehammer, and prybar won&#8217;t fix.<br />
Don&#8217;t try this at home, kids, we&#8217;re experienced professionals. (We do this to 6060 all the time.)<br />
This morning was gorgeous. Which was great for me, since I had to spend the first 45 minutes awake in the gym. Arthur (friend, co-worker, and workout buddy) has put me on a new torture regimen. He claims my butt&#8217;s going to be in severe pain tomorrow. I truly hope not. Especially with all the walking and standing I did today&#8230;<br />
A massive volunteer crew &#8212; the largest I&#8217;ve ever seen for the RMRS &#8212; was beginning to assemble when I arrived at Ogden just after 11:00 (ironically enough, I was delayed by a freight train). Thus began an hour of hurried unpacking, setting up, moving of heavy objects, taping off areas verboten, and making sure everything was ready after the various cars were switched into their locations. CP loaned us the use of a SW 900 diesel-electric switcher (#6711), their historic mail car (#3266), and towed the train down the south side of the Ogden yard for about 2200 yards before returning, to give people a little ride.<br />
The crowd we got was a lot larger than I thought it would be. We don&#8217;t publicize this (for a variety of reasons), so we don&#8217;t get a lot of people. Still, most of our chairs were filled. It was pretty impressive, I think. We had the deputy mayor, the head of CP&#8217;s Heritage division, and representatives from the RCMP out to represent not only rail history, but of course, Canada&#8217;s history. It is Canada Day, after all.<br />
The afternoon shot by. Before I knew it, the clock read 16:00, and everyone was gone. We packed up, shunted the cars, and were ready to go home just after 17:00. Which was great, because my head was killing me.<br />
That&#8217;s when I realized I&#8217;d had too much sun. Tomorrow&#8217;s gonna hurt.</p>

		<p>Heat arrived in Calgary this weekend. It&#8217;s been warm here for a few weeks now (off and on, anyway), but this was the first really hot time in the ol&#8217; town. Which, of course, is a perfect excuse to flee the city for a day.<br />
A few people in Calgary (like, half the resident population) are out this weekend. Half of Critical Mass took today off so they could get a nice four-day weekend (counting tomorrow&#8217;s national holiday). I suspect the rest of Calgary ain&#8217;t much different.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, I got a rather interesting surprise: an email from an old friend, still living in Vancouver. It appears that a couple of weekends ago, my ex-girlfriend (and ex-fiancee) got married.<br />
When I read this rather interesting piece of news, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little sad. I no longer harbour feelings towards her, one way or the other, but I found I still do for her family. I grew quite close to them when we were together, and perhaps the most pain I felt when I left was from my betrayal of their trust.<br />
No doubt I am no longer a consideration in their lives, nor should I be. I suppose that thought/feeling alone makes me sad. What is my future? I have a good job, a home, a nice car, I exercise regularly, have more friends than I really know what to do with, and have led my life as I choose to direct it. In fact, the last three years have been extremely good to me &#8212; the death of my father notwithstanding.<br />
But I come home to an empty house. I&#8217;ve got a roommate I hardly see anymore (a boyfriend and a new life outside of Critical Mass have contributed to that), and two cats. Though I love them all, they won&#8217;t share in my experiences or adventures. I have no-one to hear my victories in battle, no shoulder to cry on. Almost three and a half years. Longer than I was in any relationship.<br />
The closest I&#8217;ve come to that sort of a relationship is with Chris &#8212; possibly my dearest and closest friend. (Anyone willing to tell me I&#8217;m full of crap when I start doubting myself can&#8217;t be anything but a close friend.) Since he&#8217;s moved away, the hole in my life seems to get bigger. I try to fill it with things: new websites, trains, work, exercise. Not even the largest freight train can span the gap that I sometimes feel splitting me apart.<br />
Such was the feeling I got when I found out my ex is a married woman. There are a lot of people who believe I should feel a lot of animosity towards her. I did, three years ago. I had a lot of anger. Back then, I honestly didn&#8217;t believe that I&#8217;d feel any different as time went on. But the saying is true &#8212; time does heal all wounds.<br />
Today, I sit here and type nothing but best wishes for her and her new spouse. I hope that their lives together will be long and fruitful, that her family is happy and well. Perhaps this is the end of a chapter of my life &#8212; the last few threads tied off that allows me to move on. I don&#8217;t think this was holding me back, but that&#8217;s the strange thing about the subconscious: you never really know.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are certainly worse ways to spend Friday the 13th. There are certainly more healthy ones. But when Critical Mass decides to throw a party for its employees, you can be sure of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There will be a lot of laughs.</li>
<li>There will be a lot of drunk people. (That kind of leads back to #1.)</li>
</ol>
<p>(I should point out, for the record, that the New Year party was extremely tame. I have no idea why specifically, but it was the first time I haven&#8217;t seen at least a few co-workers completely loaded.)<br />
Unlike last year&#8217;s little surprise (see [[Critical Mass 5th Anniversary Surprise Party]]), the staff knew that this party was coming. What they didn&#8217;t know was where it was going to be. There were many theories: Sylvan Lake, Calaway Park, Banff, even whitewater rafting. Most were discounted due to distance, cost, and safety. One location that had circulated a few times was COP &#8212; Canada Olympic Park. I assumed it would not be there, since I assumed (rather poorly) that there was little for us to do there. Little did I know&#8230;<br />
Our morning began a little earlier than usual. For me, it was with a little more responsibility &#8212; I had to take a staff photo. In the six years that Critical Mass has been in business, there has never been a staff photo. This was the first time since the Kelowna trip (see [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]]) that we&#8217;ve had everyone in the same place at the same time.<br />
Since we laid six people off last week (including my roommate), we are without an &#8220;official&#8221; photographer. I guess I&#8217;m the next in line (can&#8217;t imagine why), so I was asked to take the picture. To allow this, Darrell (the VP of Operations) arranged for me to gain access to the roof of the next door building and shoot across the parking lot. Two great things about this: the angle is perfect, and the sun in the morning is great.<br />
The bad thing? Organizing that many staff is like herding cats. Which is why I was very happy to be just outside of comfortable shouting range.<br />
Pictures in hand, we boarded our busses for our unknown location (which we would soon find out was COP). We were grouped into five teams: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, White. (These are representative of the Olympic colours, of course.) This not only organizes us, but creates the groundwork for the competitive in-your-face attitudes that we generally lack in the office.<br />
Okay, it&#8217;s a chance for us to completely mock each other.<br />
The line at the bar formed as soon as the busses arrived. It took less than a few minutes for us to be kicking back in the main tent, drinking our beverage of choice (usually one of Corona or Heineken), and getting into the groove of the day. Pat and I both remarked that in some ways, the day was reminicent of the Kelowna trip &#8212; starting the day off with beer.<br />
What I would find was that as the day went on, the more I felt like I was not in Calgary. The company had whisked us away to parts unknown to engage in a weekend of total debauchery. It wasn&#8217;t to the same scale as Kelowna (I&#8217;ll be very impressed if we ever see that again), but there was so much energy from having the entire day to do (pretty much) as we pleased that everyone seemed to forget that we were (at the core) just co-workers.<br />
We began our mini-Olympics around 10:00. The events were fairly simple, and none too difficult. (They were designed to be played by the dozen or so pregnant women currently at the office.) They included Bocce-Curling (get your ball the closest to the target), Cookie Stacking (stack Oreos as fast as you can in 30 seconds, using only one hand), Channelz (using five half-pipes, run a ball around an obstacle course, moving the ball from one channel to the next every 20 feet), Memory (remember what a bunch of articles are), and Balloon Toss (tossing a water balloon between two people, increasing the distance every throw).<br />
Oh, and there was one other event. As we arrived, 10 people volunteered for a &#8220;special event&#8221;. No-one knew what it was until it started: a Scavenger Hunt. A lot of people who didn&#8217;t volunteer wanted on, and a few who did volunteer wanted off. The details of the whole thing are still sketchy. We didn&#8217;t see the Hunters until just before lunch.<br />
Although I was part of Team Yellow, I spent most of my time running around between the various events, taking pictures. I gotta say: drinking beer and running don&#8217;t mix well at all.<br />
Participants were well-behaved. For about five minutes. I mean, come on! Put a bunch of people (mostly men, admittedly) in the vicinity of filled water balloons, and well, you&#8217;re gonna have some trouble. Suffice to say, every team that left the Balloon Toss went to their next event armed. It&#8217;s a good thing we had a sunny, warm day &#8212; a number of people got a wee bit damp. (Fortunately, our adolecently-minded staff had the decency not to aim water balloons at the women in white shirts.)<br />
Things calmed down a wee bit come lunchtime. That&#8217;s when everyone put their guns down and loaded up on food. (You&#8217;d be surprised how much acting like buffoons works up an appetite.) Nothing overly fancy &#8212; just hamburgers and salads.<br />
After lunch, we were left to our own devices. Some people went off wandering, some played mini-golf, and some went to play beach volleyball. The rest sat around and chatted. Resuming my photo run, I proceeded to find interesting things to take pictures of. For some reason, I started with beach volleyball.<br />
The five courts are wedged in the last curve of the bobsled/luge track. Unlike most of the other courts I&#8217;ve seen, these had more than the 2-3 inches that you end up driving your foot through into pavement. I took the opportunity to run around a bit and get a few action shots of people playing.<br />
My first memory card full, I took a moment to rest before heading back to get the second one. That&#8217;s when Ed suggested I come play with them. Still being inebriated enough not to know any better, I hopped out on the court.<br />
Now, this wasn&#8217;t a particularly bright idea on my part. My head (along with the rest of my body) was still swimming in ol&#8217; ethyl. The actions of volleyball &#8212; whipping the head around following the ball, diving, rolling, yelling &#8212; combine against your brain&#8217;s better judgement to stay in one place and lie down. Needless to say, it&#8217;s quite the argument my body got into.<br />
While in the midst of a set that I don&#8217;t really remember, I caught a glimpse of water balloons arcing over the trees. The angle required to get the balloons over the trees was so great that the balloons never came close to the courts. That didn&#8217;t stop me from annoucing (rather loudly) that if anyone hit my camera with one of those balloons, it would be the end of them.<br />
That statement would be my downfall.<br />
About 20 minutes later, Allard (my boss) caught us in between serves to borrow my little camera. Or rather, I thought that&#8217;s what he was looking for. In reality, he was checking to make sure I was camera-free. I hadn&#8217;t seen the audience on the hill carefully hiding my big camera.<br />
Next thing I know, there&#8217;s a line of people standing on the hill. They were in plain view. You know those old cowboy movies where the angry Indians all stand in a line at the top of a ridge? It was like that, only with water balloons. And no Indians.<br />
Somehow, instinctively, I knew to run. It didn&#8217;t matter &#8212; apparently, I&#8217;d earned the privilege of being the prime target. Two balloons bounced off me, but one made a direct hit in the front, followed moments later by one in the rear.<br />
Neil ran past. (Although he still claims his innocence, I have witnesses as to his involvement.) Picking up the two balloons, I chased him all over the courts. Then Neil got smart and stopped. Before I could do anything, he&#8217;d burst the balloon in my hand, and stepped on the other. Now balloon-less, there was only one other thing I could do: chase him.<br />
For all I know, I had a blood-curdling rebel yell as I chased Neil up the hill. Someone yelled out: &#8220;Tackle him! Go for the legs!&#8221; Remembering snippets of high school gym class, I dove and grabbed the legs. From what Arthur tells me, it was a textbook tackle. All I know is that the whole effort wore me out, and there&#8217;s no video evidence.<br />
I walked around damp for most of the afternoon (like I said, it&#8217;s a good thing it was warm), constantly shedding dried grass and sand from the escapade in the volleyball court. Although I can&#8217;t say I was the wettest that day, you could put me in the top rankings, I&#8217;m sure.<br />
The winners of the games were announced towards the end of the day. I wasn&#8217;t particularly paying attention, having reached what I can only assume was the bottom of my bottle, figuratively speaking. Team Green won, partly due to their skill (I can only assume) and subterfuge (which was widely known). Hey, it&#8217;s just a game&#8230;<br />
We returned to the office to begin the *second* event of the day. Thought we were over, didn&#8217;t you? Ha! If there&#8217;s one thing Critical Mass doesn&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s when to stop. Hmm&#8230; that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing&#8230;<br />
Vicious Circle was our next port of call. We didn&#8217;t all arrive at once, but before long a large portion of the company had packed themselves into a seat somewhere. And at Vicious Circle we sat, talked, drank, snacked, and took strange pictures of everyone who was there. And then suddenly, almost without warning, people began to filter out into the night.<br />
Torin, Adrian, Jim, and myself headed to Ceili&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;m not too sure why. We ran into a couple of people from CM, but after a quick search for anyone else in the building, we found outselves alone. This meant it was time to vacate. The problem, however, was that during our search, Jim decided it was time to get another beer. (For those of you who think *I* was far-gone, you needed to see Jim.) We didn&#8217;t much want to wait for Jim to finish his beer. No problem for him &#8212; he just slipped the 3/4-full pint into his pants pocket.<br />
Out the door and down Stephen Ave. &#8212; we were headed to SkyBar, where we knew the rest of the crew could be found. We didn&#8217;t get much further past Penny Lane when I caught a glimpse of a familiar face: Sean, aka Muck, aka my cousin Pam&#8217;s boyfriend. Pam, of course, was right there. We talked briefly (the others were waiting for me, and I couldn&#8217;t very well wait around too long) before resuming our quest to SkyBar.<br />
When we reached 1st St., Jim disappeared. We were across the street from Murrietta&#8217;s, one of the cooler bars/clubs downtown. That night, they had a live band playing p-funk (basically, horn-driven music). Jim blurted something about it, and next thing we knew, he was gone. We waited around a couple of minutes, but Jim was gone. (James and I would discuss this the next day &#8212; James received two completely unintelligable voicemails from Jim over the course of the night.)<br />
Torin, Adrian, and I continued to SkyBar. There we ran into Cyndy, Ashifa, a couple of Marks, and other people I don&#8217;t quite remember now. SkyBar cover was $15. We weren&#8217;t objected to it so much as we were STARVING. Conveniently enough, Saltlik was next door. On the order for a late-night snack: a peppercorn steak.<br />
It was midnight when we hit the streets again. I&#8217;d been up for 18 hours, had at least that many beers over the course of the day, been water-bombed, run ragged, and my feet suddenly decided to tell me they were ready for revolt. As much as I would have liked to go up to SkyBar, my body cried out in defeat. It was time to go home.<br />
The lights were off, and nobody was home. (Except the cats, of course.) I assumed Tamara was out having her own breed of fun that night. For some reason, though, I felt the urge to look for a note. I found one on my computer keyboard: &#8220;Back in a few days. Enjoy your weekend!&#8221; I laughed, though probably more from being too tired. I crawled into bed next to Spaz, who was rather upset that I was making her move.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait for next year!<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Okay, before you all say &#8220;oh, there&#8217;s Geoff and his trains again!&#8221;, I would like to emphasize &#8212; for the record &#8212; that I only did this because the Society was desperate for people.<br />
The Society, of course, is the Rocky Mountain Rail Society. But you&#8217;re thinking I was up working on 6060 all weekend, guess again. I remained in town &#8230; at Heritage Park. The Park is a recreation of life in a prairies town/city circa late 1880&#8217;s to around 1910 or so. Depending on where you are in the Park, you&#8217;ll see roughly appropriate recreations. (I think only a few things in the Park are authentic &#8212; most were rebuilt from pictures and plans.)<br />
One of the things Heritage Park has done for the last 17 years is hold something called &#8220;Railway Days&#8221;. It&#8217;s a draw that brings out more people to the Park, and causes the local modellers and rail hobbyist organizations to come out and show off their things. Naturally, this brings out the Society to show off what we&#8217;ve got, raise a few bucks for funding, and hopefully snag a few more members.<br />
Don, who organizes all the local events (I sometimes wonder if he actually sleeps at nights), asked me to be there most of the weekend &#8212; all of Sunday. I didn&#8217;t have any firm plans otherwise, and agreed. I arrived an hour early Saturday morning, expecting to have to go through the rigamarole of setting up the displays. Everything was already in place when I arrived.<br />
I had an hour to kill. This gave me an excellent chance to wander around the Park. I haven&#8217;t seen much outside of the roundhouse, coach house, and the main street. I didn&#8217;t go for a huge walk, but got a better idea of what the Park is like. Luckily, the weather was infinitely better than last year&#8217;s (for once, I have no entry to link to!) &#8212; it was bitterly cool and rainy the entire weekend, keeping the people away. On Saturday, we had bright, sunny skies, and though it started off a little cool, warmed up very nicely.<br />
We were put into the roundhouse, along with the other commercial interests. This was a little disheartening &#8212; we&#8217;re not commercial. We&#8217;re non-profit. We sell things, yes, but just to earn some money so we can pay for projects we need to do. As it stands, we only made $600 for the weekend, and our profit margins on that stuff is quite low.<br />
Of course, we&#8217;re not there so much to make money. Our goal is to raise awareness. We&#8217;ve been around almost 20 years now, but we&#8217;re not known outside the rail community. Even within the community, we regularly get stories that 6060 has been permanently retired and put up on static display. It&#8217;s particularly a challenge when we&#8217;re told this to our faces at trade shows.<br />
It&#8217;s so much easier when you can roll your steam locomotive into a town, pop open a door and announce &#8220;We&#8217;re here!&#8221;<br />
Fortunately, we didn&#8217;t have too much trouble with people finding us. As the roundhouse is a fairly major attraction, and we were right next to the door, we had a steady stream of visitors both days. Last year, we were in the Coach House, which is virtually buried behind the railway tracks and beyond the roundhouse. Unless you happen to see the signs, you are definitely going to miss it.<br />
Oh yeah, assuming you haven&#8217;t already figured it out, Heritage Park has its own self-contained railway. It&#8217;s nothing particularly fancy &#8212; a big loop with a turntable and roundhouse, a siding for storing the &#8220;freight&#8221; train, and two stations. Two locomotives ply the rails on Railway Days (usually, it&#8217;s just one), both 0-6-0 switchers. They&#8217;re painted as CP 2023 and CP 2024.<br />
It&#8217;s with some irony that in a CP town, Heritage Park ended up with two small steam locomotives originally from (of all places) the US Army. Both started off with the Army, moved to New Westminster in BC where they worked the docks until the mid-60s. They eventually found their way to Heritage Park where they were fixed up and put to use. (They were originally US Army #4012 and #4076.)<br />
Heritage Park does have two actual CP steam locomotives: another 0-6-0, #6144, which now operates with a diesel engine; and CP 5931, one of two preserved Selkirks (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Canadian Railway Museum]]) &#8212; the largest locomotives used in Canada. (There is widespread belief 5931 could run again, but the politics behind doing so dwarf the massive engine by many times.)<br />
Amidst people coming and going (and Don running around to help out with the presentations), I made a couple of opportunities to go take pictures. When you&#8217;ve got two steam locomotives double-heading (basically, running end-to-end), you make an effort. Especially if the weather&#8217;s good.<br />
Early afternoon arrived, and we had so many people at the booth that I didn&#8217;t see a need for me to be there anymore. So making sure all was well, I ducked out to enjoy the rest of my afternoon.<br />
Sunday, it rained. It was raining when I got up, it rained off and on until just before lunch, and then rained pretty much consistently for the rest of the day. Naturally, this staved off the numbers of people we&#8217;d seen the day before, but it wasn&#8217;t *so* bad. It gave us more time to watch the videos we show constantly.<br />
I spent all Sunday at Heritage Park. It wasn&#8217;t the most rivetting way to spend the day, but at the same time I can certainly think of worse things to do.<br />
Besides, I got to watch the trains.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While this weekend was absolutely amazing, too many of these and I&#8217;ll die from exhaustion.<br />
I started early Saturday morning. Those of you who are chiming in with &#8220;must be train stuff&#8221; can smile smugly &#8212; &#8216;cuz you&#8217;re right. But it wasn&#8217;t with 6060. This was my first chase since 6060 last year (see [[Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley]]), and this was a lot more challenging. 6060 doesn&#8217;t move very fast &#8212; it can&#8217;t because of the track it runs on. This chase, however, as significantly faster.<br />
The Canadian Pacific Railway is taking their steam locomotive, 2816, out east on the &#8220;Breakfast for Learning&#8221; tour. It&#8217;s the biggest run they&#8217;ve done since the engine was overhauled. From here to Toronto and back, in about 45 days, making a lot of stops between here and Toronto. Saturday was their first leg, from Calgary to Medicine Hat. And I wanted to follow it across the prairies.<br />
I decided I would pick up the train at the old CP Ogden shops (now owned and operated by Alstom). Although the east end of Alyth had a great place to take a picture with a bridge, the light wasn&#8217;t cooperative, and there was no place to park my car. I was the first to show up at my location, but I was soon joined by a few others: the director who was responsible for the locomotive and the train, one of the other members of the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, the parents of one of the train&#8217;s crew, and a guy who had been born and raised in the Ogden area and who&#8217;s father had opened the nearby Ogden Garage in the 1920s.<br />
The train was to leave at 7:00, but started off the day running late, for some reason. When it finally reached us, around 7:20 or so, it looked gorgeous, and running beautifully. It passed by at about 30 km/h &#8212; not very fast. Not yet, anyway. Piling into my car, I gave chase.<br />
I was hoping to catch the train at the east end of the intermodal yard on the east side of the city. But due to a wad of people getting in my way, the train ended up alluding me. Because of the much warmer weather than the last time I chased 2816 (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]), there was no steam cloud to see at a distance. All I had to rely on was the fireman every so often putting too much oil in the burner and creating a bit of smoke. I still don&#8217;t have a scanner, which makes following the train&#8217;s progress very difficult.<br />
Passing the intermodal yard, I started onto a gravel road, with two other cars in front of me. I couldn&#8217;t see anything but the dust cloud they kicked up. Finally, we reached a paved road, and I turned south to try and catch up. I reached 22X, and headed east again. I had no idea where the train was, other than it was ahead of me.<br />
The new map I had purchased at the ESSO station actually showed where the railway went, and I still had to go a fair bit south to find the line again. That&#8217;s the problem with chasing trains on the prairies &#8212; the highways rarely follow the tracks. At least on the Laggan sub, I can keep up because there ain&#8217;t a lot of room &#8212; and there the highway *does* follow the railway.<br />
I raced down Highway 24, hoping I&#8217;d be able to catch the train down there. Just as I came over a hill near to where the 24 turns east, I saw the train coming to the crossing. I arrived mere seconds before the train crossed it, but I didn&#8217;t have time to get a picture. The chase was on again!<br />
Further down the road, I stopped in a farmer&#8217;s field east of Carseland to take a picture. As the railway was curving away again, I had to race down more highways to hook back up again. I turned out on to Highway 817 and then onto 901 to continue following. At this point, the train wasn&#8217;t too hard to follow &#8212; the tracks weren&#8217;t too far from the road. The train got held up in Strangmuir for 15 minutes to undergo some greasing, which allowed me to find a comfy little field that sported a small bridge that the train was going to go over. There I found one of CP&#8217;s rail traffic controllers (RTCs), who dispatched the Brooks sub (the line we were both chasing down). He didn&#8217;t go on shift until noon, so had some time to chase.<br />
I caught the train again where the tracks cross the 901, along with a few others including an A-Channel truck. Then to Gleichen, where I met a rather racist CP police officer, snapped a photo, and ran off to Cluny. There, I met up with the RTC again. He suggested Bassano as the next decent stop, so off we went. This time, I followed him, and it was good that I did. He led me right to the best spot to get a picture. Pretty much where everyone else chasing the train was: an old CP railway station and a rather large yard.<br />
There I met a couple of far more professional photographers who suggested my next venue: the Brooks Aqueduct. Once the train had left, we were off. Brooks is about 180 kilometres southeast of Calgary, heading towards Medicine Hat. Brooks is pretty much the last stop before you enter the vast, barren plains of the southern prairies. There ain&#8217;t much in Brooks, which really surprised me when I saw on my map a marker for &#8220;Brooks Aqueduct National Historic Site&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t too hard to find. All you have to do is find the sign on the highway, and drive south until you see a huge concrete aqueduct, like a modern version of a Roman aqueduct.<br />
But modern it isn&#8217;t. I parked in the interpretive centre&#8217;s lot, and was immediately met by Lee, one of the two interpreters at the site. She was a little puzzled by why I was there &#8212; though most of their visitors come from Calgary. I explained that I was chasing a train. Yes, I did get a rather strange look. She recommended that I walk down the aqueduct canal to the siphon, which was apparently the best place to see trains in the area. Thanking her for the advice, and promising to come back, I went off in search of my quarry.<br />
The canal is a huge earthen trench built up on the floor of the shallow valley that Brooks sits in. Barely 100 metres to the north of the canal is the old aqueduct, no longer in service. (More on it in a moment.) I walked until the canal &#8220;ended&#8221; at the railway &#8212; where an inverse siphon runs under the railroad and re-enters the canal on the other side. The siphon works on the venturi principle &#8212; basically, what goes in has gotta come out.<br />
I was well ahead of the train, which gave me a lot of time to wander around and find the best place to take a picture. By the time I&#8217;d found the ideal place, three more photographers showed up, including the guys who&#8217;d told me about the place. We took our positions and waited.<br />
Soon, the light appeared in the distance, and the train raced towards us. Though not going at full speed, it didn&#8217;t take long to pass. I have to completely agree with Lee and the photographers &#8212; the aqueduct was the best place to see this train.<br />
I returned to the interpretive centre, where Lee came out to meet me. I asked her for her perspective on the aqueduct. (I told you I was getting back to this.) Back in the early 1900s, CP was in the colonizing business. There was a lot of money to be made in bringing people to the west. Especially if you&#8217;d bought all the land around the railway tracks when you built them, and sold it off to the immigrants who paid you to come west. However, not all parts of the west were ideal for farming &#8212; some are quite dry.<br />
Such is the case with the area east of Brooks. No significant rivers, no lakes, and little rainfall poses a lot of problems. To make the area saleable, CP had to provide water for irrigation. This lead to the need to dam the Bow River at Bassano, then move the water through canals to the east. At Brooks, the land forms into a shallow valley that created a problem &#8212; without massive (and expensive) pumps, there was no way to get the water to the east. CP&#8217;s engineering department came up with the solution: the Brooks Aqueduct.<br />
At 3.2 kilometres long, and upwards of 90 feet tall, it was the largest aqueduct in the world at the time. It pushed all the boundaries of construction knowledge, which also led to problems. Most revolutions don&#8217;t go off very well the first time. The alkaline water dissolved the concrete, the lead expansion joints leaked constantly, the spars across the top of the sluice caused backflow, and the 0.01% grade kept the water moving so slowly that silt, plants, and even fish slowed the water flow. The aqueduct only ever reached 2/3 of its planned capacity. After an extensive and expensive overhaul in the 1930s, the aqueduct was turned over to the local farming collective.<br />
By the 1970s, the aqueduct was costing too much to repair. The local governments decided to replace it with an earthen canal that provided more water than the aqueduct ever could have (even if it had reached full capacity), and doesn&#8217;t leak. The old aqueduct was made a National Historic Site in the 1980s.<br />
I drove down the length of the aqueduct to get a good look at it. Well, as much as I could. Once decommissioned, the aqueduct no longer received maintenance. To prevent injury, a fence runs around the perimeter. A gap in the fence did allow me to sneak in for a couple of pictures from underneath. The western end, completely cut off from the original water supply, is now home to the local party hangout, identified from the graffiti, countless broken beer bottles, and the still-smouldering remnants of a fire. The view down the aqueduct is something else.<br />
It was about then that I noticed the time: 12:45. I needed to be back in Calgary for a party at 14:00. I was going to be late.<br />
I pulled into the car wash at 16th Ave. and Edmonton Trail just before 15:00. The car had turned a brownish green (from all the dust), with multicoloured speckling (from all the bugs). It was shiny in only a few minutes. Then it was my turn to get clean.<br />
I arrived at Shantie&#8217;s house just before 16:00. This was a soccer party, and as near as I could figure, I was one of the only non-soccer people invited. Needless to say, I wasn&#8217;t too keen to leap right into the game. Mostly because I haven&#8217;t played since high school, and even then I was terrible. I resolved to sit in the weak shade of a tree (not all the trees here have sprouted leaves yet) and take pictures. The six-year old daughter of one of the guests noticed it right away and asked if she could use it. It&#8217;s a durable little thing, and I figured &#8212; could get some interesting pictures.<br />
The girl, Shayla, took almost 150 pictures over the next few hours.<br />
The game ended around 17:00 and we retreated to Shantie&#8217;s house (across the street from the soccer field) to engage in conversation and food. John (one of the other guests) tried to engage in a battle of wits with Shayla. The six year old won, hands down. It was just the beginning.<br />
Shantie has some really great friends. They&#8217;re hilarious to hang around with, and are in no way exclusionary. They even knew when to pick on me because I brought veggie burgers. (Relax, I haven&#8217;t gone vegan &#8212; but I&#8217;ve had these sitting in my freezer for a year, and I gotta eat &#8217;em.)<br />
I ended up talking with Lindsay for over an hour about Japan. (She&#8217;d been there in high school.) We talked until it was just too cool to be away from the fire pit everyone else had gathered around. (I should note that it was gorgeously warm, and it was just a slightly cool breeze that was making it uncomfortable. Besides, we were feeling left out.)<br />
By midnight, everyone had left, including myself. I&#8217;d been up for 18 hours, was harbouring a half-dozen sunburns, and needed some serious sleep.<br />
Today was the Lilac Festival in Calgary. I didn&#8217;t go to it this year, as I felt I had more pressing things to take care of: namely the small army of dandelions that were laying siege to my front lawn. Screwdriver in hand, I went to eradicate the little buggers from my grass.<br />
Most people use chemicals when they get rid of weeds. I&#8217;m not a big fan of chemicals in the yard, not even fertilizers. I prefer the natural, brute force methods. I even use an unpowered push mower to cut my grass. Yeah, it&#8217;s hard work, but you feel better for it. Especially when total strangers thank you for not using chemicals.<br />
While there was still a lot of afternoon left, I went for a walk along the river, taking in the sights and sounds of the World Walk, or something like that, taking place at Prince&#8217;s Island Park. I didn&#8217;t spend long, so I don&#8217;t really know what it was all about. I had a mission: I needed to get my bike.<br />
People were everywhere. Calgary becomes very active when it gets warm. When there&#8217;s a festival on, you almost have problems moving at times. Along all the major strips, the patios are open and full. Everyone is enjoying the outdoors again. Summer is definitely here.<br />
Now if it would just rain so we could all cool off&#8230;</p>

		<p>When I finally arrived home from my stint with the CBC so many months ago (see [[Home for a rest]]), I was happy to be back. It will be nice to be home after my trip to Japan, even though it&#8217;s sad to leave it so soon.<br />
When I arrived almost two weeks ago, I had no idea what to expect. There were a lot of questions, intrepidation, excitement, and desire. The fear would not last long, and I certainly got a healthy dose of adventure. But there is simply too much to see and do in Japan &#8212; you could visit for a year and before you could see enough to be satisfied.<br />

		<p>I think a good rule of thumb for how long you should stay in one place while on vacation is your comfort level. When you become too comfortable, you&#8217;ve stayed too long. I&#8217;ve become very comfortable with Tokyo.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say I&#8217;m bored with Tokyo &#8212; far from it. This city &#8212; this country, in fact &#8212; has so much to offer that it is seriously impossible to cover all of it in a mere two weeks. I could spend almost two weeks in Tokyo alone! I wish I didn&#8217;t have to go home right away, so I could spend more time seeing the country. Four days remain.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After a few days of non-stop touring, a slow day is much appreciated, even though it wasn&#8217;t planned that way.<br />
Chris was up before me, starting to clean up the apartment. It wasn&#8217;t messy by any means, but today we&#8217;re expecting the arrival of Ellesen, one of Chris&#8217; friends from university and from film school. Supposedly, we&#8217;re going to have five people here on Sunday night, so there&#8217;s going to be a big effort to have enough room for all of us to sleep.<br />
Chris also needed to finish up some work for his school &#8212; a flyer that will encourage people to come and take classes. Then we had to meet up with Naome in Chiba to pass off the disc with the design. All of this, and we planned to hit the National Museum of Japanese History.<br />
By the time we left the house, it was 13:30. Based on instructions, we were to meet in front of the Starbucks in the Corridor Mall next to the Chiba JR Station. Problem: Just like in North America, there is the possibility for more than one Starbucks in the same mall. We stood in front of the one we thought was the only one for about 20 minutes before we got a hold of Naome, who was in front of a different Starbucks.<br />
While we were waiting, we saw another great example of Japanese order. A bicycle was parked next to the Starbucks entrance, but inside the mall. (The mall has no outer doors, so it&#8217;s possible to cycle right through it without getting off.) Parking the bike there was a no-no, and the police officer who found it wasn&#8217;t too happy about it. After checking that it wasn&#8217;t ours, he wrote a ticket.<br />
Now, here&#8217;s the question: How do you write a ticket for a misplaced bicycle? You don&#8217;t attach it to the bike. You attach it to the wall where the bike was, and then impound the bike.<br />
We finally met up with Naome and handed off the disk. While there, we met Ken, a New Zealander also teaching with Chris&#8217; company. Then it was off onto the Keisei line (a privately-owned line separate from the JR lines) to try and get to Sakura, location of the museum.<br />
The Seikei line is a local line, and makes a lot of stops. In fact, it made so many stops that we felt there wouldn&#8217;t be enough time to see the museum before we&#8217;d have to be back in Yotsukaido to meet Ellison when her train arrived sometime after 17:00.<br />
At the stop before Tsudanuma, we abandoned the quest for the museum. Instead, we decided to try for the temple in Narita. We switched to the JR line and headed for Narita. It&#8217;s a fairly long trip. Although only three stops after Yotsukaido, the gaps between the stops become significantly longer.<br />
Narita is the airport town. The airport itself is a fair distance away, but this is the first major stop from the airport. Hence, it&#8217;s very international. It&#8217;s probably the most western city in this part of Japan, after Tokyo. It&#8217;s also possibly the most stereotypically-looking Japanese city I&#8217;ve visited. Part of it sits on a hill, has the winding streets with high buildings on either side, with narrow little alleys. The area from the JR station to the temple is quaint and picturesque.<br />
The Daihonzan Naritasan Shinshoji Temple complex is immense, covering many acres of land. It&#8217;s founding is also very old, started in the (western) year 940. The founding monk is entombed on the property.<br />
After going through the gates, you cross over a small bridge over a small pond. On the other side is a fairly steep staircase going up the side of the hill. On the hill are many statues and stone markers. Whether they are graves of previous monks, I don&#8217;t know &#8212; the complex isn&#8217;t littered with explanation signs in English. (I do have to say, though, that with a bit of planning, this place could very easily became a UNESCO site &#8230; that is, assuming it already isn&#8217;t.)<br />
At the top of the staircase is the shrine. It&#8217;s a huge Buddhist-style building. In front is the ever-present incense burner, and to the right is a fairly large pagoda. Unfortunately, by the time we got there, the altar had closed for the day. Protected behind a sheet of glass, I couldn&#8217;t even take a picture of it (because of the glare).<br />
We walked around the surrounding area a bit before realizing there was a terrace above the shrine. Up there were important cultural properties, including a votive hall, the tomb of the founding monk, and a couple of other buildings. Over the trees, the top of another pagoda &#8212; one with a golden spire &#8212; was clearly visible. This is the one we could see from the JR station.<br />
The one is huge. It&#8217;s 53.1 metres tall. It&#8217;s such a beautiful building &#8212; perfect symmetry, vibrant colours, the sparkle of reverence. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s for something important, but I don&#8217;t know what.<br />
It was already just after 17:00, just when Ellesen&#8217;s train was due to arrive in Tokyo (she was coming from Morioka in northern Japan, on a Shinkansen). She still had to change trains and come to Yotsukaido, but we needed to head back and meet her at the station.<br />
After a bit of a wait at the Narita station, we caught a very bumpy ride back home. Along the way, we saw a beautiful sunset. Sort of ironic, seeing as Japan is supposed to be the Land of the Rising Sun.<br />
We were earlier than Ellesen&#8217;s train &#8212; she was still in Chiba awaiting the next train to Yotsukaido. This gave us enough time to quickly hit the video arcade.<br />
Meeting up with Ellesen, we headed back to the apartment to unload our bags. After a quick trip to the gas station to get more kerosene for Chris&#8217; space heater, we headed back to the JR station, and into Chiba, where we met up with Naome and went for dinner.<br />
I&#8217;m kind of beginning to feel like a local. The trips are becoming commonplace, and even the restaurant we went to was the same as the one Chris and I went to two nights ago (see [[My Trip to Japan, Shinkansen to Mount Fuji]]).<br />
Returning home a couple of hours later, Ellesen, Chris, and I talked well into the night. Well, they talked &#8212; I fell asleep. Even the assistance of caffeine from a small bottle of Coke didn&#8217;t help.<br />
There are no set plans for tomorrow. &#8220;Tokyo&#8221; is the only word.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Japanese have borrowed many concepts of rail management from North America. For instance, you will generally see words like &#8220;rapid&#8221; or &#8220;limited express&#8221; when you see train listings. And you&#8217;ll see them written in English as well as in Japanese.<br />
But Japanese trains are far more efficient and run on very tight schedules. Unlike North America, you can time your watch to the trains here. If you think you might be a minute late for your train, you&#8217;re going to miss it. That&#8217;s how we missed the express train this morning &#8212; we resigned ourselves to having missed it. Probably for the best, too &#8212; it looked full.<br />
Arriving in Tokyo, we headed from the JR train to the Maranouchi subway line. A couple of stops, and we changed to the Hibiya line. This would take us to within a short walking distance of the Tsukiji Fish Market.<br />
What the heck were we doing at a fish market? This ain&#8217;t just any ordinary market&#8230;<br />
Imagine a place where every single aquatic foodstuff for an entire country is bought and sold in mass quantities on a near-daily basis. Something so massively huge that it sucks up several city blocks. This is the Tsukiji Fish Market.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure whether or not every single fish consumed in Japan comes through here, but it sure as heck looks that way. The traffic going through the complex is mind-boggling. Although the market&#8217;s day begins somewhere around 02:00 in the morning and finishes by 14:00 in the afternoon, the traffic at 10:30 is still a blur. The last of the larger trucks arrive to pick up thousands upon thousands of Styrofoam packing crates with fish &#8212; alive and frozen (or =-otherwise chilled) &#8212; and whisk them off to parts unknown. Hundreds of small gasoline powered carts whiz around seemingly without care for pedestrians. And there is always the constant drone of motor scooters and delivery bikes.<br />
The market itself is open to the public &#8212; anyone can go walking inside, and you can buy direct from the wholesalers. Just be forewarned that you should go in with a pair of rubber boots. The floors are all wet, and the vendors don&#8217;t think twice about emptying the water from containers right onto the floor &#8212; and they don&#8217;t look before they tip.<br />
Now you&#8217;d think that the smell in this place would be overpowering &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing quite like the stench of rotting fish. There is no smell at Tsukiji &#8212; that&#8217;s how fresh the fish is. Nothing ever gets the chance to go bad.<br />
By the time Chris and I arrived, there was not as much fish as there had likely been earlier in the day. The tuna auction, usually held at 05:00, was long over and most of the large trucks had carted the fish away. We found only two hamachi (yellow-tail) tuna remaining.<br />
Think of any fish. Actually, pretty much anything that lives in the water and would be consumed in reasonably large quantities. Chances are, it&#8217;s in there somewhere. Squid, cuttlefish, red snapper, orange roughie, conch, abalone, scallops &#8212; they&#8217;re all part of the seafood currency the market deals with every day. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why seafood in Japan is so good.<br />
To find out how good, Chris and I decided to partake of one of the nearby sushi bars to find out what uber-fresh sushi was like. We didn&#8217;t walk into the first place we saw, though &#8212; we ended up flipping a coin to choose.<br />
The place was small, having barely 15 seats. At peak, the restaurant is probably packed with patrons from the fish wholesale industry. By the time we got there, it was nigh-empty &#8212; only one person. Chris and I took our seats, and began to figure out what we were going to eat.<br />
Chris engaged in a conversation with the chefs, who suggested a set. Deciding it sounded like a good idea, we sat down to watch our meal being prepared. It was served in a wet banana leaf, with a heaping of pickled ginger, a large cup of fresh green tea, and a bowl of miso soup with fish.<br />
The experience was amazing. Chris carried on a competent conversation with the staff, telling them about some of our experiences (including our somewhat-failed attempt to see Mount Fuji yesterday). We were rewarded (I think) with hand-rolls for our troubles.<br />
We were not full, but satiated when it was time for us to leave. It was raining, so a quick departure wasn&#8217;t possible. A quick stop to one of the stalls in the area provided two umbrellas. (A note to anyone who gets caught in the rain at Tsukiji &#8212; don&#8217;t buy an umbrella there. Sprint a block away to the Outer Market and buy one there at half-price.)<br />
We headed down the road Outer Market and perused the stalls. (Apparently, there&#8217;s a great 24 hour sushi restaurant in there somewhere.) Then it was towards the subway station we&#8217;d arrived at. But not before one little distraction&#8230;<br />
Right next to the subway station is a Buddhist temple &#8212; the Tsukiji Hongwanji Temple. This particular temple was built in 1931, after the previous one was destroyed in an earthquake in 1923. (The first temple was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1657.)<br />
Returning to the station, we boarded the Yamanote line again, this time for the Hamamatsucho station. This is where you&#8217;ll find Tokyo&#8217;s main bus terminal, which is where we would take our bus tour of Tokyo.<br />
Being a little early, Chris and I did a little exploring. We found our way to the Observatory atop Tokyo&#8217;s World Trade Center (not to be confused with the late WTC in New York). From here, we were provided excellent views of the greater downtown Tokyo area. Or rather, we would have been, had the weather been a bit better. But we did pretty well, all things considered.<br />
After circling the Observatory, we returned to the bus terminal to await the start of our tour. The first part of the tour wasn&#8217;t actually on a bus. Our guide, Yoshi, took us on the first part of the trip &#8230; to the Observatory in the World Trade Center.<br />
Chris and I just laughed at the coincidence. The staff in the Observatory smiled when they saw us again.<br />
The trip back up wasn&#8217;t a total washout &#8212; Yoshi did tell us more information about Tokyo than we knew when we were last up there.<br />
One interesting fact that kept coming up was how much Tokyo had once been controlled by Shogun. In the days before Imperial control of all of Japan, large portions of the country &#8212; especially the eastern portion &#8212; was ruled by shogun, not the emperor. Back then, Edo (now Tokyo) was ruled by powerful shogun.<br />
When Matthew Perry arrived in Japan and arranged to allow American ships to dock in Tokyo harbour in the 1860&#8217;s, the shogun had no choice but to accept the &#8220;offer&#8221; of the more powerful American naval vessels. Soon, the Europeans were doing the same thing, and the shogun appeared almost powerless. The samurai voted to overthrow the shogun, and install the Emperor in his place. To facilitate the change, the Emperor moved from Kyoto in 1867 to Edo, and renamed it &#8220;Eastern Capital&#8221;, or Tokyo.<br />
Many of the original buildings from the shogun era still exist, including a shrine at the foot of Tokyo Tower, the Zojoji Temple, the Hama-rikyu Garden (a former hunting ground for the shogun) and the Imperial Palace complex (appropriated by the Emperor in 1867).<br />
The bus tour began once we got back downstairs. Our first stop was at the main gate of the Imperial Palace.<br />
The Imperial Palace grounds are immense, but not as large as they used to be. Today, the outer moat is gone, though one still exists on the outside of the main wall. The main wall has been divided to allow traffic through the palace grounds, though one road is blocked for use only by the Emperor.<br />
The Palace is closed to the public except for two days a year &#8212; 2 January and 23 December. Otherwise, you can only see the Palace from the outside. But even those glimpses are of a world far older than anything North America has to offer, and of a culture in ways alien to my own,<br />
After snapping a large number of pictures, we headed off to our second stop at Asakusa Kannon Temple. The route from the Imperial Palace to the temple would also take us through the Ginza district and also the Akeharbara district.<br />
According to legend, the temple dates back to the (western) year 628, when two fishermen found a statue of Kannon in the river. (Kannon is an image of Buddha.) The statue became the central point for the monastery, which was built around the original shrine over the next 1,000 years. Today, the statue is said to still exist, though it is well-hidden. Not even the monks see the statue. A previous emperor is said to have sent four people to prove that the statue still exists (the Emperor himself did not come).<br />
As our guide then tells the story, the four people then died. (Of course, she didn&#8217;t say when&#8230;)<br />
The Asakusa Kannon Temple is a little strange. It&#8217;s still active, but has been blended with a strange commercialism. Leading up to the temple from the road is the Nakamise Shopping Street. It exists with the boundaries of the temple grounds, and basically forms an alleyway leading up to the temple. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any direct connection with the temple itself, but I suspect there&#8217;s some sort of mutual benefit.<br />
The temple it quite an interesting place. Although protected for tourists (or for pigeons, I&#8217;m not sure which), it still retains its mystical qualities. If you&#8217;ve been to a Buddhist temple before, you&#8217;ll know what I mean. If you haven&#8217;t, you should visit one.<br />
We couldn&#8217;t stay long, as we had to rush to get on our boat for the cruise down the Sumida River.<br />
The cruise isn&#8217;t particularly riveting, but it does offer an interesting point of view. We cruised along for about 45 minutes, passing buildings and under bridges, before entering the edges of Tokyo Bay and ending at the cruise ship dock. It was back on the bus, back to the station, and then back on the trains to Chiba.<br />
After running an errand, we ate at Skylark, possibly the most western-like restaurant I&#8217;ve eaten at since arriving in Japan. But even at a western-like restaurant, you can find purely Japanese food. Even mushrooms I actually like.<br />
It&#8217;s been a long day. Tomorrow we&#8217;re playing it light &#8212; just a visit to the Natural History Museum.<br />
Which probably means a much shorter entry&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We woke up relatively early this morning. For anyone on vacation, that&#8217;s before noon. For us, it was around 09:00. The goal today was Mount Fuji, about an hour south of Tokyo.<br />
An hour by bullet, that is.<br />
Following the usual rise-and-go routine of the morning (shower, shave, etc.), we made a run to the 7-11 before heading to the train. I know it sounds really strange to say we&#8217;re going to a 7-11, even when I&#8217;m in very urban (almost rural) Japan. One thing you&#8217;ll find there is there are a lot of American chain stores and restaurants: Starbucks, AM PM, Lawson&#8217;s (which I hadn&#8217;t heard of before coming here), Subway, the ubiquitous McDonald&#8217;s, 7-11, Red Lobster, and even Denny&#8217;s.<br />
In most cases, though, the store/restaurant is very different than in North America. For example, you won&#8217;t find pretty much any North American food in a 7-11 &#8212; it&#8217;s all Japanese food, although along similar lines that you&#8217;d find in a North American 7-11. (And beer. You don&#8217;t get that in Canada.) One of the neat things are these little triangular rice cakes wrapped in nori (seaweed), usually with some sort of extra flavouring, like salmon, pork, and so forth. They&#8217;re amazing for breakfast.<br />
The really cool thing about these triangles is in how they&#8217;re packaged. The seaweed needs to be kept dry, while the rice needs to stay moist. This is done by using the most elaborately-arranged plastic wrapping that I&#8217;ve ever seen. Once you see how it works, it&#8217;s truly elegant, though it is a little confusing at first.<br />
Upon arriving in Tokyo, we made our way to the Shinkansen area. The Shinkansen are the legendary Japanese &#8220;bullet&#8221; trains. They run at extremely high speeds (about 250 km/h), and are extremely convenient when getting between cities that are close enough not to fly, but far enough that driving is just inconvenient. (Of course, if you don&#8217;t have a car, then the train is all the better.) They&#8217;re not the fastest trains in the world (that record is held by France&#8217;s TGV), but they&#8217;re no slouches, either.<br />
The Kodomo Superexpress runs from Tokyo terminal to Shi-Osaka, making about 10 stops along the way. The distance is quite far &#8212; probably about 400 kilometres or more. (That&#8217;s a guess, as I have no maps or figures.) It&#8217;ll do the trip in about two hours, including the station stops.<br />
The Shinkansen lines are separate from the other rail lines used for regular commuter trains. The slower-speed trains use jointed rail (lengths of rail linked together with plates). This is fine for slow-speed travel, but not for high-speed passenger travel. The gaps between the rail lengths would cause shuddering in the train as it slammed across them. The rails would deform and the wheels of the train would be damaged. So much more expensive (and labour-intensive) continuous welded rail must be used instead.<br />
The Shinkansen itself is like an airplane. The seats are built roughly the same way, but are a little lower (assumedly for the smaller stature of the average Japanese person) and have no seat belts. The train runs so smoothly that you have no need for one.<br />
The train pulled out of the station at about 12:15. It accelerated to about 100 km/h within a very short distance of the station, but didn&#8217;t go much faster until we were outside Tokyo city limits. This wasn&#8217;t because of safety &#8212; this was because the tracks had to follow a very curvy path before being allowed to run straight. Shinkansen, like any high-speed train, prefers straightaways over curves.<br />
You can&#8217;t really feel the acceleration of the train, like you would an airplane taking off, but you do notice the change in speed. I&#8217;ve heard from several people who have ridden the TGV that the movement is noticeable, but only if you&#8217;re paying attention. Otherwise, the motion is almost magical.<br />
Soon, the countryside was whipping by at speeds that would make my eyes hurt if I tried to follow something that was fairly close to the train. The city quickly gave way to smaller towns and villages. Farms, old houses, small factories, rivers &#8230; the rural life passed us by faster than the time most rural folk give thought to the trappings of city life.<br />
The plains of the coast gave way to mountains, and the train started darting in and out of mountains. I think there are more tunnels on the Kodomo line than there are in the entire Canadian Pacific Railway system. High speed trains don&#8217;t go over or around mountains &#8212; they go through them. And sometimes so fast and frequently, you can actually start to feel your ears pop from the constant pressure change.<br />
Just outside of Mishumi, we caught our first glance of our quarry &#8212; Mount Fuji, off the in the distance. It wasn&#8217;t quite what I expected. The &#8220;traditional&#8221; crown of white snow was little more than stripes, assumedly from the spring melts. I can only assume the white cap is only in winter. I snapped pictures from the train as we passed through.<br />
We had been told by many people that the place to see the mountain was in Shizuoka. We stayed on the train until we got to the stop. According to maps and photos, we could go a short distance and obtain some very nice photos. However, there was a minor problem &#8230; we couldn&#8217;t see the mountain.<br />
Chris enquired, and we were told that we were better off going back one stop on the local Tokaido line to obtain a better picture. Hopping on the local train, we found the situation not any better. Apparently, we had run into Fuji&#8217;s most famous problem. According to Chris&#8217; friend Shinichiro, Mount Fuji is very shy. We had just found out how shy it was.<br />
We returned to Shizuoka, and took the next Shinkansen to Shin-Fuji, which apparently was the best place to see the mountain when the weather wasn&#8217;t cooperating. By the time we arrived in Shin-Fuji, clouds had almost entirely obscured the mountain. Living near mountains myself, I know how volatile the weather can be. Figuring it wasn&#8217;t quite worth leaving just yet, Chris and I decided to grab a bite to eat and hope the weather clears.<br />
Not wanting to stay at the station, we went in search of a restaurant. An initial look around the station wasn&#8217;t terribly promising. So Chris enquired about the location of downtown Shin-Fuji from some bus drivers. They laughed incredulously.<br />
&#8220;Downtown?&#8221; they cried, &#8220;There&#8217;s no downtown here!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What do you do for fun?&#8221; Chris asked.<br />
&#8220;Go to Tokyo.&#8221;<br />
Not wanting to take that for a literal answer, we decided to find out what Shin-Fuji was all about. Heading south of the station, we found our way to the corner of the major street near the station and what appeared to be a local highway. We followed it for a couple of kilometres before deciding to turn north and wander through a neighbourhood to see what we could find.<br />
Not much.<br />
It seems that the bus drivers hadn&#8217;t been kidding &#8212; there isn&#8217;t a heck of a lot of anything in Shin-Fuji. All we found were varying states of nothing. All we got were stunned looks from some of the locals. I mean, what were a pair of gaijin (one a tattooed black man) doing wandering through a neighbourhood like theirs? Had they become lost from the train?<br />
We ended up back at the station, completely empty-handed, and hungry. North of the station wasn&#8217;t any better, although we didn&#8217;t walk even remotely as far before giving up. Instead, we caught the next eastbound Shinkansen to Tokyo. The trains&#8217; gently motion soon put me to sleep.<br />
We got off in Chiba, rather than continue all the way to Yotsukaido. Chris wanted to pick up a gift for Kaz, and we would get something to eat before heading home for the night. After our stop at Yodobashi Camera, we hit a restaurant that features izakawa-style food, which is basically the Japanese version of pub food (though much better prepared and probably a lot better for you, too).<br />
So far, I&#8217;ve had several varieties of Japanese food, and I like them all. Even the dreaded natto. The best part is that almost all of it is very good for you, too. Japanese cuisine, even the stuff that&#8217;s considered &#8220;fast&#8221;, is so much healthier than North American food. I can only guess how much weight I could lose here from eating better. I only wish such foods were readily available in Canada.<br />
It&#8217;s an odd thing, really. The Japanese have some of the best diets in the world, but simultaneously are some of the heaviest smokers I&#8217;ve seen in years. The dichotomy of healthy/unhealthy habits is quite astonishing.<br />
We were back in Yotsukaido before 22:00 &#8212; Chris has some design work to do, and having an early evening for a change sounded good.<br />
Besides, it gave me a good excuse to hit the 7-11 for dessert. A couple snacks, a bottle of Fanta Fruit Punch, and we were back to rest and relax for an evening. Tomorrow, the tour of Tokyo!<br />
Oh, and Haagen-Dasz makes a killer green tea ice cream.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today was a bit of a late start for us. Not for any particular reason, we just slept in a little bit.<br />
Today was Tokyo day. Sure, we&#8217;d been to Tokyo before for clubbing (see [[My Trip to Japan, Tokyo and Shibuya|yesterday]]), but I didn&#8217;t really see much of Tokyo. It&#8217;s hard to get a good idea of a place when you don&#8217;t actually see it.<br />
We boarded the train just after noon and headed into Chiba, where we switched from the local to the train to Tokyo. The ride in was much more interesting than the last one &#8212; I could actually see where we were going. It was more interesting than on the highway, since the highway is mostly blocked off with sound barriers.<br />
Arriving at Tokyo station, we wound our way up to the Yamanote line, which runs in a circle around the city. This would take us to our first location of the day &#8212; Akehabara. If you&#8217;ve never heard of the place, you might have heard of a place in Tokyo where you can find almost anything electronic. This is that place.<br />
The moment we exited the station, we were confronted with a huge wall of bright signs, neon lights, and blasting sounds of electronics for sale. It was time to see what really interesting things I could find.<br />
We went into the first store along our path. Six stories of geek heaven. Digital cameras, video cameras, computers, televisions, stereo systems, Minidiscs &#8212; you name it. It was all there. All for the taking, if the price is right&#8230;<br />
Which of course begs the question &#8212; is the price worth it? Well, that all depends on what you&#8217;re looking for. If you want something unique, hard-to-find, or so cutting edge it&#8217;s not available in North America, then you&#8217;re in luck. Otherwise, there&#8217;s not really a lot of benefit &#8212; you&#8217;re probably better off getting it where you are.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t looking for anything in particular &#8212; a new digital camera might be nice, as would a Minidisc player, but the only thing I really had an interest in was a mini stereo system for my kitchen. I&#8217;ve been searching high and low for one that meets my rather meagre needs: multiple discs and detachable speakers that aren&#8217;t hard-wired. Over a year of searching in Canada had resulted in nothing. But here in Tokyo, I figured I had a chance.<br />
The first mini system I saw had exactly what I wanted. For about $500. Interesting thing, though: it was only one of two such systems I saw al day. Through a dozen different stores, I only saw one other system that fit the bill. Eight thousand kilometres, and only two systems.<br />
The biggest irony? Not much different than I could have got at home.<br />
That didn&#8217;t stop us from hitting store after store, seeing what we could find. Lots of neat stuff, but none of it that we really needed. (Note that I&#8217;m not saying &#8220;wanted&#8221; &#8212; you can always want something.)<br />
After about two hours, we gave up on Akehabara, and wandered out into the city to see what else was around. We passed by the transportation museum, and decided it was time to find out what was down the next alley.<br />
Tokyo is littered with small roads (that would be classified as alleyways in most North American cities), each one different from the next, barely unidentifiable, and almost always unmarked (or so it seems). But they are always fascinating.<br />
We stopped for an early dinner, some time around 17:30. We popped into a ramen shop for some noodles. The shop worked a little differently than others I&#8217;ve seen. Here, you put coins in a machine, which dispensed a ticket. You turned the ticket over to the cooks, who then made your order. My order, purely by my own lack of knowledge of ramen intricacies, was actually cold. Although not exactly what I was looking for, it was still very good.<br />
We kept walking after our meal, turning at random streets and seeing where they went. Without really knowing where we were, we soon appeared in front of the Tokyo train station &#8212; more or less where we wanted to be anyway.<br />
The Tokyo train station is old &#8212; built with western stylings, I can only guess it was build in the 1920s. It certainly predates World War II. From the outside, it doesn&#8217;t really look that big. But it goes a long way underground, and covers a lot of area above ground. The first time I arrived at the station, I had no idea where I was going. Now, I might be able to figure out where I&#8217;m going. Maybe.<br />
Back to the Yamanote line, we headed in the opposite direction, this time heading to Shibuya. I wanted to see one of the most famous districts in Tokyo.<br />
Shibuya is one of about three fashion districts in Tokyo. Like every other district in Tokyo, Shibuya has its distinctive denizens and a unique style from other areas. It&#8217;s a little grittier than other parts of Tokyo (at least the ones I&#8217;ve seen so far), but it&#8217;s still nice compared to similar areas of virtually every North American city.<br />
We started at the intersection at the Shibuya station &#8212; one of the most famous in the world. It&#8217;s the one that always seems to be shown when the subject involves Tokyo nightlife. The number of people at this intersection alone is incredible. It makes New York City look deserted.<br />
And so we wandered. I know I&#8217;ve used that word a lot, but it&#8217;s the most appropriate considering how we explored the neighbourhood. Up one road, hit a fork, go down another road. Most of the time, this would lead us into another interesting place we hadn&#8217;t seen.<br />
But it also sometimes led us into shadier areas. One road in particular was littered with strip clubs and love hotels. A &#8220;love hotel&#8221; is pretty much what you&#8217;re currently thinking it is &#8212; a place where a couple can go to be with each other in private. Most people in this country stay at home until their mid-to-late 20s.<br />
After a while, we ended up in front of the HMV. While a store I can find in Canada, I wanted to see if I could find some of the albums I was asked to hunt down while here. Besides, listening to music is still a favoured past-time.<br />
We found one of the albums, Chris piping in that he had copies of some of the albums my friend is looking for. I&#8217;ll have to check in with my friend to see if that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s looking for. I&#8217;m in town for a while yet to come, so I&#8217;ll have time to figure this all out.<br />
Coming out of HMV, we went in search of something else to do. It ended up being a near-half hour search for something to eat, mostly so my poor feet could get a bit of a break. All that standing and walking around had reduced my feet to some serious pain.<br />
We ended up at a yakatori restaurant, which is basically grilled foods on a stick. Doesn&#8217;t sound like much, I know, but believe me &#8212; it was really tasty. And not being very large, it was just was I needed before we headed off on our next adventure.<br />
Which ended up being getting our butts back to the train as fast as possible so we could get home. We got all the way to Chiba before the trains went out of service. We ended up having to take a taxi to Yotsukaido.<br />
But no worries. Tomorrow is another day, and another adventure in Japan!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve gone clubbing in Tokyo, and lived to tell about it.<br />
It&#8217;s an odd statement, I know, but allow me to explain.<br />
Chris and I didn&#8217;t have any real set plans. In fact, I didn&#8217;t really know what we were going to do until about 22:30, or so, when Chris came back and woke me up (stupid jet lag).<br />
The plan was to go into Tokyo to Shinjuku station, where we would head over to a club for a VJ party. I had no idea what that meant, but it sounded interesting. Of course, there is always a catch &#8212; and you might have already guessed what it is.<br />
Yep, the trains. Because the ones to the outlying areas stop at midnight, if you go into Tokyo to go to a club or see a late concert, you&#8217;re there for the rest of the night. Tokyo clubs have adapted to this, though, and are open until very late &#8230; or very early, depending on your point of view.<br />
Scott called us around 22:00 with most of the details we needed. However, we also needed to be on the train &#8230; pretty much right when Scott called us.<br />
With a bit of haste, we grabbed the 23:35 train from Yotsukaido to Chiba. There, we transferred to the 23:50 train to Tokyo &#8212; probably the last one of the night. Most people got out of the train by the time we arrived in Tokyo station, but there were still a few left. Once there, Chris navigated the rats nest of directional arrows and track numbers to find the Mitaka Line (I think that&#8217;s what it was called), which would take us to the opposite side of the city. This was where we found find Chris&#8217; friends.<br />
Well, almost. We arrived at the station where we would transfer to a fourth train, taking us right to where we needed to be. Problem: the trains had stopped for the night by the time we arrived. Many people who had missed the trains themselves were now camped out on the station floor, awaiting first service in the morning. For us, it was taxi time.<br />
Taxis in Tokyo are a little strange. You generally don&#8217;t open the door &#8212; the driver does remotely. I&#8217;m not entire sure why that is, but it&#8217;s probably something to do with being sanitary.<br />
Chris was on his cell phone. Not talking, but receiving messages from Scott on directions and names. This was how Chris directed the taxi driver to our location.<br />
The cell phone, particularly with younger people, is the single most important form of communication in Japan. Everyone has one, and you see them everywhere &#8212; especially on the trains. At least half the young people, especially those riding alone, will be engrossed with something on their phone, usually for the entire trip of wherever they&#8217;re going.<br />
(Scott had an interesting point of view: the phones have their pros and cons, but the cons are mostly superficial. Most likely, it&#8217;s that they&#8217;re status symbols and have to be updated frequently.)<br />
The taxi dropped us off at the station we would have gone to, were the trains running. We would be met by Chris&#8217; friends, who would walk us to the club.<br />
We didn&#8217;t have to wait long, them appearing on the staircase from an overpass moments after we returned from a quick run to a convenience store.<br />
It was Scott and Masame (a woman). Scott is another English teacher who lives in Narita city. He&#8217;s been here four years, and shows no signs of ever moving back to Ottawa. He seems to be having far too good a time to consider going anywhere.<br />
We went up the stairs and down a road that for a moment made me think we were in Scarborough. Of course, the traffic on the left side of the road, signs I could barely read, and the constant blur of Japanese cars reminded me constantly that we were in other country.<br />
It reminded me of something Keith Black had said our the group of us who went to the Soviet Union in 1989 (see [[Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Introduction|Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union]]) &#8212; &#8220;Smile, you&#8217;re in another country!&#8221;<br />
At the time, none of us understood or really appreciated what he was trying to say. Fourteen years later, I find myself repeating that to myself constantly. Not because I need to smile, but because I understand.<br />
The first club was the smallest club I&#8217;ve ever seen, not even three times the size of my (rather small) living room. Along the wall across from the door was the bar, the wall next to the door featured the VJs. Next to the VJs were some small couches, and the opposite wall was the receiving end of their projector.<br />
The projector was what made them VJs. They&#8217;re not VJs in the sense of MuchMusic or MTV VJs &#8212; here, it&#8217;s video in the sense of how DJs spin music. Instead of music, they mix images and short snippets of video. The resulting output doesn&#8217;t really make sense, but is meant to compliment the music. It&#8217;s something that I can see hitting North America soon.<br />
I met Chris&#8217; friends, most of whom were very nice. Masame spoke the most English, the rest very little. Miyuki (Scott&#8217;s girlfriend) speaks none at all.<br />
Smile, you&#8217;re in another country!<br />
We stayed at the club until around 02:00, when we departed for another club. Tokyo is littered with small clubs &#8212; all you have to do is turn down a small alley and you&#8217;ll find one. They&#8217;re in small store fronts, basements, pretty much anywhere you can pack in at least 20 people.<br />
The next one, Mix, was in Aoyama, very close to Shibuya. It took us a moment to get the right place (Miyuki ran up and down the sidewalk a few times talking on her cell phone before we finally found it), but went in. The sign on the door read: &#8220;Open 22:00 to Close&#8221;.<br />
It was small, about 2-3 times the size of the last club, but it was quite packed with people. The cover to get in was about 2,500 yen (about CDN$31), but that also included two drinks (which is all I had while there). Covers to clubs are very expensive here in Tokyo, but if you go to the right place, the price is reasonable. The club featured the DJ from Tokyo Number One Soul Set, which probably added a bit to the price.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how fast time can fly at a club like this. The music was amazing. I know a lot of people who&#8217;d be very jealous if they knew what I&#8217;d experienced. There&#8217;s nothing like being in a small space with two professional DJs, a literal wall of speakers (including the most powerful bass I&#8217;ve felt in years), and (pardon the term) the most phat tunes I&#8217;ve heard spun live yet.<br />
Being one of perhaps four non-Japanese in the place, and probably the only one who didn&#8217;t speak Japanese, you&#8217;d probably think I&#8217;d have a hard time fitting in. But meeting people here is even easier than in Canada.<br />
One person I met goes under the name Ricky. He&#8217;s been training for eight years to be a champion boxer &#8212; though to look at him, you&#8217;d never know. Ricky&#8217;s English wasn&#8217;t that strong, but we still managed to have a conversation about each other, including ages (he&#8217;s 28), occupations (though I needed Chris to translate as I couldn&#8217;t think of a way to say simply what I do), and talked about Tokyo and what I should see and do.<br />
Language is something that I&#8217;ve become acutely aware of. And I&#8217;m not referring to the native language &#8212; I&#8217;m referring to my own. Most of the Japanese I&#8217;ve met here do not understand the intricacies of English, so explaining things the way I normally do doesn&#8217;t work. I need to chose my words very carefully so that I&#8217;m not introducing words that they would definitely not know. It&#8217;s not like speaking to a child who doesn&#8217;t have a grasp of language, it&#8217;s thinking like someone who&#8217;s learning another language and has at least a basic understanding of a language, and building off the vocabulary they already have.<br />
Our group gathered together about 05:15 and headed out into the early Tokyo morning. The sun had already started its rise. It was very peculiar to walk from a dark room into the light. Usually, it&#8217;s the other way around (like going to see a movie in the early evening and walk out into darkness).<br />
We wandered down the street in search of something to eat. Miyuki didn&#8217;t wander so much as she veered around, the others trying to keep her from steering herself out onto the road. Scott ended up piggy-backing her for a while.<br />
Somewhere inside Shibuya (the neighbouring district), the group split in two. Half went for noodles, the other half to First Kitchen for &#8230; something that sort of resembled the first meal of the day. Somehow, a bad hot dog and deep-fried battered red bean paste molded in the shape of a fish doesn&#8217;t really strike me as all that nutritious.<br />
There had been a great temptation for us to stay in Tokyo and tour around. But Chris was fast falling asleep, and I was beginning to be not too far behind him. And so we began our trip home.<br />
Scott and Miyuki took the train back to Narita. Masame and one of the other women drove home, while Nobu drove Chris, another woman whose name I can&#8217;t remember, and myself back to Yotsukaido (they all lived in the area).<br />
The drive back was interesting, to say the least. Tokyo is a labyrinth of streets and highways. The highways are all raised, and snake around the skyscrapers in tight paths, like a ribbon strung around trees in a forest. One minute we were far away from Tokyo Tower, the next right next to it, and I couldn&#8217;t figure out how that had happened.<br />
I was enthralled with the passing city. It&#8217;s one thing to take the train (which we did in the dark, so I didn&#8217;t see anything, anyway), but entirely another to see it by car &#8212; especially from a raised highway.<br />
Slowly, the massive skyscrapers gave way to low-rises. It became possible to see just how far the city goes. It looks like southern Ontario &#8212; stretching out forever. You cross massive rivers and can see small, traditional houses, even the odd shanty.<br />
Chris slept the whole way. I just had to place faith in our driver, because I had no idea where we were. In fact, when we finally arrived in Yotsukaido, we came in from a direction that I didn&#8217;t think was possible to come in from.<br />
Chris and I returned home for some sleep, crawling into be around 08:00. We would continue our day a little later&#8230;<br />
&#8212;-<br />
We woke around 13:30, when the phone rang. It was a friend (though I don&#8217;t know who). We rose and began our second part of the day. First order of the day, a quick run to the bank for Chris to get some money, and then off to Chiba.<br />
Transactions here are all in cash &#8212; aside from credit cards, most things are cash. It&#8217;s not uncommon for someone to have 50,000 yen or more (roughly $625) in their wallets at any time. The Interac system we&#8217;ve come to depend on so highly in Canada does not exist in the most efficient and technological country in the world.<br />
I&#8217;ve done the drip into Chiba so many times now that I don&#8217;t look out the window anymore. I actually feel like I&#8217;m beginning to fit in here. The language doesn&#8217;t bother me anymore, the fact that I&#8217;m a gaijin doesn&#8217;t concern me. I can see why Chris has had so little trouble being himself.<br />
Chiba station was busy, but it only took us a few minutes to find our way out. We were heading for Parco, one of the major shopping centres in Chiba. But first, we were going to hit Yodabashi Camera. But not for my sake&#8230;<br />
May 5th is Chris&#8217; first anniversary of engagement to Kazume. He wants to give her a gift. Originally, he was thinking a bracelet, but he knows that Kaz would like a camera so she can take pictures. This is probably one of the best camera shops outside Akehabara in Tokyo.<br />
You name it, they got it. Cameras I&#8217;ve never seen or even heard of. My personal favourite was a tiny little thing &#8212; a 2.0 megapixel Sony you could fit in your pocket along with a large wallet. It was perfect for Kaz. Heck, I&#8217;m thinking of one for myself!<br />
After the camera shop, we wandered into an arcade &#8212; more advanced than the one I&#8217;d been into the first day I was here (see [[My Trip to Japan, Calgary to Yotsukaido|my first day in Japan]]). Time Crisis III, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, and a game where you have to be a DJ and play with both hands on a split screen at amazing speeds. Things we haven&#8217;t seen in Canada yet.<br />
We went to Parco next. Chris quickly decided that the camera was best &#8212; the jewelry wasn&#8217;t really cutting it for him. That said, we hit the mall, going to the hobby shop first to look at (what else?) Japanese toys. Surprisingly enough, there are a large number of ones from North America, too.<br />
A floor down, we met one of Chris&#8217; friends. In Calgary, Chris had the ability to meet people anywhere, including stores. Chris knew almost the entire staff of the A&amp;B Sound downtown. He&#8217;s not quite like that here, but this particular girl he knew only from this store. She spoke very little English, but Chris was more than able to carry out the conversation in Japanese.<br />
Both quite hungry from lack of food, we felt it was time for lunch. Next to Parco is a little restaurant called Freshness Burger (yes, you can giggle at the odd use of English syntax). It&#8217;s fast food, but like all Japanese fast food, only made when you order it. I had a very tasty nemimiso burger (essentially a miso patty with lots of shredded raw onion).<br />
While we ate, Chris received a message about a party that night at the home of Seiko, Chris&#8217; head manager. (We&#8217;d known about it from before, but we needed to RSVP.) We were to get a ride with Naome, another one of Chris&#8217; managers.<br />
First, we needed to hit a bakery. Chris wanted to bring something with us &#8212; never show up empty-handed. This meant a trip to Mitsukoshi, one of the other malls in town. Mitsukoshi is much higher-end than Parco. Parco would be like Sears or the Bay &#8212; Mitsukoshi is that fancy boutique mall where all the stores are like Louis Vitton, Tiffany of New York, and where the &#8220;food court garden&#8221; has the legendary $50 melons.<br />
(For the record, you can get melons in regular stores that don&#8217;t cost that much.)<br />
Returning to Parco (where we were to meet Naome), we got drinks at the Starbucks and waited. We didn&#8217;t wait long &#8212; Naome showed up not much later. From there, we went to the Tower Records in the mall.<br />
One thing about Parco that will throw off North Americans is how the mall is laid out. It is a mall, though it looks like a standard department store. The mall is divided into areas, most without defined walls. It allows easier passage, but can cause confusion because you&#8217;re not used to it.<br />
Chris and I listened to music while Naome tried to find the album she was looking for. Apparently, all she new was that the band had three members. She didn&#8217;t know a song or album name. Pick a country, and there&#8217;s always someone like this&#8230;<br />
Finding Naome&#8217;s car became a treasure hunt. She couldn&#8217;t remember exactly where she&#8217;d parked. It took a few minutes, but we eventually found her car a couple of blocks away. Then came the fun part as she tried to negotiate her way to Seiko&#8217;s. Even with a navigation system, Naome got turned around more than once.<br />
Before we could leave the downtown area, Chris&#8217; phone rang. It was Charlie, another one of the teachers. He and his girlfriend were at the station, and were coming to Seiko&#8217;s. Naome turned the car around and we went to pick them up.<br />
Naome&#8217;s little car was barely big enough to fit the five of us. Putting two large North American men (Charlie and I) does pose a few size problems. Mind you, I don&#8217;t think I can fit five people in the Mini, so I&#8217;m hardly one to complain.<br />
Don&#8217;t ask me how we got to Seiko&#8217;s house. I haven&#8217;t a clue. There seems to be no such thing as a straight road in Japan &#8212; they all weave in and out all over the place. Eventually, we arrived at a quiet little complex.<br />
Seiko is 50 years old &#8212; though she looks barely 35. (Miyuki, Scott&#8217;s girlfriend, is 32, though looks 16.) Sometimes I wish I were born Japanese &#8212; it&#8217;s the ultimate anti-aging device.<br />
Seiko&#8217;s house was small &#8212; not much bigger than my own (though I didn&#8217;t see the upstairs). She had prepared a Japanese buffet for us. I found out the reason was because this was in celebration of Naome&#8217;s 31st birthday, coming up this Thursday.<br />
The meal consisted of picked root salad, sliced ham (or pork, I&#8217;m not sure which), octopus salad (very tasty), bread, a sushi roll, and rice cakes. The diversity was quite interesting.<br />
I&#8217;m extremely thankful for the opportunity to attend the party, because it gave me a clear picture of what a typically Japanese meal is like. Simple, but with a number of items that we simply don&#8217;t see in North America. Luckily, I&#8217;m not the picky eater I used to be &#8212; I ate everything that was made available.<br />
That includes something called natto. Seiko and Naome found out I&#8217;d never had natto before, and wanted to see what I thought of it. Natto is a fermented bean that is usually mixed with other foodstuffs (though there are people who probably eat it on its own). It&#8217;s usually quite sticky, fairly bitter, and the texture is generally not what most westerners would enjoy.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t eat it. Luckily, Seiko and Naome were very generous in preparing it, making it far more palatable to my more delicate tastes. I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily eat an entire bowl of natto, but I wouldn&#8217;t be adverse to it.<br />
Cake and Earl Grey tea marked the end of our evening. By that point, I was quite tired, the remnants of the night before having caught up to me &#8230; and probably with the last of my jet lag.<br />
Naome drove us back to our respective places in Yotsukaido (we had expected just to be taken to the train). We were dropped off at the 7-11, barely a two-minute walk from Chris&#8217; apartment. I was asleep within minutes of hitting the tatami mat.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>By comparison with yesterday&#8217;s activities, it would appear that I slept the entire day away.<br />
For starters, I awoke after 10:00, the long day previous having sapped pretty much all my energy. Kaz was still here, but preparing to leave for Toyohashi. I needed a shower, and badly,<br />
This was my first Japanese shower. Western showers are tall things, often allowing you to stand vertically while cleaning. In Japan, the shower is a small, open tub in a well-tiled room that has a shower head mounted to the wall.<br />
Japanese flats, or at least Chris&#8217;, has no running hot water (there is cold water). All hot water comes from a small water heater that sits right next to the tub. It feeds hot water as needed.<br />
It was then that I realized the things I had forgotten for this trip. Phone numbers aside, I had also managed to forget shampoo and conditioner. I don&#8217;t think my scalp will have too much trouble with this humid climate, so hopefully, I&#8217;ll be alright.<br />
Kaz left around 11:30, leaving Chris and I to kill a little time until 13:30, when it was time for Chris to go to work. Today, he taught a class in Narita. (Chris teaches in several places, including here in Yotsukaido &#8212; this just happens to be roughly in the middle of his various teaching gigs.)<br />
I would go the opposite direction, to Chiba City. Yes, I was there last night, but I wanted to see the city in the daytime. So Chris entered one platform, and I went to another. Chris looked perfect at ease waiting for his train. I felt a little &#8230; odd.<br />
I&#8217;m finally understanding what it feels like to be the only person of a particular race in an area. Since arriving, Jan is the only other Caucasian I&#8217;ve actually met. Today, I didn&#8217;t see a single other non-Japanese (not counting Chris).<br />
It&#8217;s actually neat in a way &#8212; it&#8217;s a slight special feeling, but at the same time, no-one really seems to care. It&#8217;s kind of like: &#8220;oh, look, a strange gaijin&#8230;&#8221; and I&#8217;m forgotten within a few steps.<br />
In fact, the only longer glances I got were from the school girls. And no, this is not a fantasy come true.<br />
I do need to make a note of this, though. Japanese school girls pretty much meet the stereotype we&#8217;ve seen in the west: the uniforms, the giggling, and the really creepy sexuality that either their completely innocent of, or completely aware of (and you have no idea which it is). Suffice to say, I saw one girl eating an ice cream cone and &#8230; well, it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve not yet forgotten.<br />
Chiba doesn&#8217;t look much different in daylight than it did at night. The biggest difference were the throngs of people &#8212; far more than last night. Of course, it was also a weekend (it&#8217;s Saturday), so it might have also been weekend trips to the semi-big city.<br />
I wandered around a little, trying to follow the route we&#8217;d taken last night, only in reverse. I missed a turn, though, and ended up with a longer walk. Not that I minded.<br />
I snapped pictures as I wandered around: the monorail and its tracks, the canal it runs overtop of (and the fish that swim in it), city streets, cars, and people &#8212; specifically, a guy dressed in a frog suit trying to entice people to enter a pachinko parlour.<br />
Along the way, I decided to visit Parco, a local department store In many ways, Parco reminds me of The Bay or of Eaton&#8217;s. Lots of small boutique-like areas with each floor dedicated to a specific need. The prices were about right in line with what you&#8217;d expect in Canada.<br />
I refrained from buying anything. This is for two reasons: One, I need to look around a little more, first. Second, I have very little money. This is due to lack of foresight on my part. I have no traveller&#8217;s cheques. I had assumed, rather foolishly I might add, that I could use my bank card here to obtain Yen directly. So far, I have yet to find an ATM that can access the North American networks. And I haven&#8217;t set up my credit cards to allow funds withdrawals.<br />
To anyone coming to Japan for a visit, remember to bring either traveller&#8217;s cheques or a healthy amount of yen. Getting access to the funds you need from your back without a lot of trouble is, well, a lot of trouble. In fact, after two days, I get the distinct feeling I&#8217;ll need to go into Tokyo to finally get out some cash.<br />
I found my way back to Yotsukaido without too much difficulty. After taking a couple pictures of the train station, I headed back to Chris&#8217; flat to rest a little while before going out to take more pictures. I decided to watch one of Chris&#8217; movies (Blade II) and take a little nap. Chris woke me a bare half-hour ago (it&#8217;s now 20:45), having fallen asleep on this futon.<br />
The loose plan now is to go to something called a &#8220;VJ party&#8221; in Shibuya, one of the districts of Tokyo. The catch? If we go, we&#8217;re there until 05:00 at the earliest &#8212; the trains don&#8217;t run after midnight.<br />
I want to go &#8230; I just hope my body is ready for this.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It hasn&#8217;t been that long since my last outing, but it&#8217;s time again for my next great adventure. This time, I&#8217;m leaving the continent for the first time in almost 14 years &#8212; I&#8217;m going to Japan.<br />
Chris is staying there another year, and I&#8217;m going to take advantage of that by going out and visiting him. It&#8217;s been far too long since the last time I saw my best friend, and I shudder to thing that it&#8217;ll be at least another year before I&#8217;d see him again.<br />
This won&#8217;t be a cheap trip, that&#8217;s for sure. This will probably put me so far into debt that I&#8217;ll be lucky to leave Calgary, let alone travel anywhere. But hey, if you only live once, then you&#8217;d best darn-well live it!<br />
I&#8217;m currently sitting in Seat 47A of my Boeing 747-400, awaiting the departure of our plane from San Francisco Airport. I sit here with a mix of excitement and fear. Excitement for doing something new and unusual, but fear of the unknown. I don&#8217;t know what I will see, or how everything will unfold.<br />
I don&#8217;t know why I sense fear at these sorts of things &#8212; I love a challenge and I love adventure. I suppose it&#8217;s an autonomic response &#8212; my subconscious telling me something, I suppose. But I&#8217;m not going to let it stop me &#8212; not when there&#8217;s something new to explore!<br />
&#8212;-<br />
We&#8217;re still about six hours from landing. I haven&#8217;t been on a flight this long since I visited the Soviet Union in 1989. This flight is considerably longer for me &#8212; and a little more daunting. The Pacific Ocean is a lot larger than the Atlantic.<br />
All the blinds in the plane are closed, and most of the lights turned off. Most of the people are sleeping, even though it&#8217;s late afternoon. (I&#8217;d be getting off work in about 10 minutes were I still in Calgary.) If I do open the blinds, all I can see is ocean and cloud. No ships, no land.<br />
Travelling like this is a little odd. For all I know, I could be in a virtual simulator of a plane. When I enter I&#8217;m in San Francisco, and when I exit I&#8217;m miraculously transported to Tokyo. Mind you, I&#8217;ve always found air travel like this.<br />
The flight is mostly empty. I have an entire row to myself, as does the man in the row ahead of me. There is no-one for two rows behind me. I don&#8217;t know if this is normal for these flights, but considering United Airlines 837 runs New York &#8211; San Francisco &#8211; Narita &#8211; Seoul, I&#8217;d think there&#8217;d be a few more people here. Maybe it&#8217;s fears of SARS or of flying during the waning days of the Iraq war. I don&#8217;t know, but having this much space to myself is almost as much a luxury as first class.<br />
It&#8217;s a long way to Japan yet, and I&#8217;ve still got a lot of daytime ahead of me.<br />
&#8212;-<br />
I faded in and out of sleep over the course of the flight, trying desperately to adjust myself to arriving in mid-afternoon Tokyo. Even the idea of drinking as much as possible in hopes the alcohol would put me out didn&#8217;t help. (For the record, I didn&#8217;t ever get drink, but I did have two beers in succession.)<br />
I woke from my third rather fitful nap about two hours out of Narita. All I could see was ocean, cloud, sky, and a really big freakin&#8217; wing. The third movie of the flight, &#8220;Two Weeks&#8217; Notice&#8221; was just finishing. (We&#8217;d already seen &#8220;Clockstoppers&#8221; and &#8220;Star Trek: Nemesis&#8221;.) The second meal service was about to begin &#8212; I&#8217;d had teriyaki chicken the first time, so I went with the non-chicken option: a very tasty three-cheese pasta.<br />
Half an hour before landing, all we could see was cloud. The plane soon descended into the thick white cover, and everything vanished from view &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t even see the wing.<br />
For about 20 minutes, we bobbed through the clouds. Outside, the clouds went from absolute pure white to a medium gray. I looked down out the window, hoping that I&#8217;d see something through the haze.<br />
Slowly, shapes peeked through. Then the clouds peeled back like a movie dissolve to reveal the Japanese countryside. Rice fields, highways, country paths, small farms, collectives &#8212; it was exactly as I&#8217;d imagined.<br />
The flight arrived about 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Pulling into the terminal, we deplaned and found our way to immigration. Narita is a big airport &#8212; it&#8217;s a long way away from the gate I came in at.<br />
The Japanese immigration process, according to the video we saw on the plane, works like this: You enter through a series of health inspection booths, then through immigration. After that, you find your bags, and then go through customs. It looked pretty straight-forward, though I had two reservations. First, I&#8217;m Canadian, and these SARS fears could detain me. Second, I didn&#8217;t have Chris&#8217; address in Yotsukaido, which meant I might have trouble going through immigration.<br />
The health inspection booths were closed, so we went right through. As I passed, I saw a sign asking residents of certain cities worldwide to go to the Health Inspection Office before going through immigration. Toronto was on the list.<br />
Immigration was only half-open, but the line was quite short. In about 10 minutes, we went through the line and it was my turn to convince the officer it was safe to let me into the country.<br />
&#8220;What address are you staying at in Yotsukaido?&#8221;<br />
I did my best to look completely sheepish and explained that I&#8217;d completely forgotten to bring the address, and the phone number (which was asked for immediately after). She looked at me, at the passport, at the embarkation form, and them back at me. Stone-faced. I wasn&#8217;t nervous &#8230; yet. But then she stamped the passport, the form, and welcomed me in.<br />
My bag was already waiting, so all I had to do was grab it, take off the plastic bag, and huck over to the customs line. It went something like this:<br />
&#8220;Are these all your bags?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do you have anything to declare.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No, I do not.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Thank you, welcome to Japan.&#8221;<br />
Kaz was supposed to be waiting for me, but wasn&#8217;t there yet. Luckily, the arrival area is quite small, so there was little chance of me missing her. Instead, I just leaned up against a wall and waited.<br />
After about 30 minutes, I started getting worried. Was Kaz here and missed me? (I was afraid I wasn&#8217;t going to remember what she looked like.) I thought about calling her or Chris. Problem: no phone numbers. I didn&#8217;t have either Chris&#8217; house number or his cell number. I didn&#8217;t have Kaz&#8217;s number. I didn&#8217;t have Chris&#8217; address. Basically, if Kaz didn&#8217;t show up, I was going to have some trouble.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say I was entirely screwed. Worst-case scenario, I&#8217;d call Tamara back in Calgary, and have her pull Chris&#8217; number from my cell phone, and check my email to see if Chris had sent any cell numbers.<br />
&#8220;Geoff!&#8221;<br />
Kaz appeared from out of nowhere, and suddenly, I felt a lot better. We grabbed the bags and started working on getting to Yotsukaido. Right after a quick bathroom break. While Kaz made use of the facilities, I grabbed a quick drink of water from the fountain. I had a Homer Simpson moment:<br />
&#8220;Mmmm&#8230; foreign water&#8230;&#8221;<br />
The train to Yotsukaido left at 16:00, about an hour from when Kaz found me. Having time to kill, we went to have a coffee &#8230; at Starbucks. (I swear, you can&#8217;t get away from the place!) Although I have to say, I didn&#8217;t really mind &#8212; I wanted to see how different it is. The interior is a spitting image, save for the Japanese on the menu. The sizes are smaller than North America (a good thing) and the hot chocolate tastes a little different. But nothing too drastic.<br />
We boarded the train around 16:50. This particular train was a local &#8212; although it does go all the way to Tokyo, it stops at most stops on the way. Yotsukaido is considered a local stop. It looks little more than a large subway train &#8230; just with more advertisements covering virtually every surface, and hanging from the roof.<br />
And we think we have it bad in North America!<br />
The train zipped through the countryside, heading towards the urban jungle that surrounds Tokyo. Slowly, the rice fields gave way to parking lots and shopping malls. At the Narita city stop, we joined another train before continuing our trip towards Tokyo.<br />
We finally arrived in Yotsukaido around 17:40, and disembarked from the train. Kaz immediately called Chris from her cell. We could already see him rounding the corner &#8212; the familiar orangy leather jacket bursting out from the surrounding cacophony of dark suits and dresses.<br />
I haven&#8217;t seen Chris since I took him to the airport nearly a year ago (see [[Chris Goes to Japan &#8230; the Second Time]]). It didn&#8217;t take long for me to feel like I&#8217;d only seen him last week.<br />
Chris took us to his school &#8212; barely a minute walk from the train station. It was a lot smaller than I&#8217;d imagined. Three stories, but barely had a footprint of 10 metres by 10 metres.<br />
In Japan, everything is vertical.<br />
Chris introduced us to his (somewhat eccentric) coworkers, including his managers and another teacher named Jan, pronounced &#8220;Yan&#8221;. (Jan is also Chris&#8217; next door neighbour.) He called my name as he walked down the stairs, and for a moment I thought he knew me from somewhere else. But it turns out he was just being a smarty-pants, hearing my name from higher up the stairs.<br />
Kaz, Jan, and I left Chris to his own devices and headed over to Chris&#8217; flat so I could drop off my (rather heavy) bag and explore a bit.<br />
The first exploration was just going to Chris&#8217; flat. Narrow streets, small houses with elaborate courtyards, cars that I&#8217;ve never seen before, and more vending machines than in all of Calgary. From there, the three of us headed to Mos Burger for something to eat.<br />
Mos Burger is the rough equivalent to a Japanese Harvey&#8217;s. They have hamburgers of many kinds (according to Jan, they&#8217;re more like meatloaf burgers). I had a rice burger (rice patties instead of bread buns) filled with seafood and vegetables. Extremely tasty.<br />
Jan had to return to work, so Kaz and I had to kill some time before Chris was available again. Kaz decided to show me around downtown Yotsukaido.<br />
It doesn&#8217;t take long. It&#8217;s not very big.<br />
One thing of note was the toy store. It&#8217;s not like any toy store I&#8217;ve been to &#8212; lots of kitchy little things, mostly Japanese (for obvious reasons), but with a fair few North American things thrown in for flavour.<br />
Downstairs was a video arcade. It was a peculiar mix of new games we haven&#8217;t seen in North America yet, and games we haven&#8217;t seen for a decade. The arcades are smoky places, which is not particularly great, so chances are I won&#8217;t be spending too much time in them.<br />
One game of note was a Kodo drumming game, similar to Samba Di Amigo or Dance Dance Revolutions. Kaz challenged me to a game, which I did reluctantly. Although much more fair than North America (it cost a little more than a dollar, but we got three plays out of it), Kaz whipped my keister.<br />
When Chris got off work, we decided we&#8217;d go for sushi &#8230; in Chiba City. Yotsukaido is a suburb of Chiba, which is a suburb of Tokyo. Chiba City is a couple of stops down from Yotsukaido.<br />
Chiba City looks more like the stereotypically Japanese city &#8212; lots of lights, overhead monorail, the dark roads with lots of cars.<br />
We went into a sushi bar that used a long conveyor belt to move items around. We didn&#8217;t really use it, though, favouring instead to order directly. Well, Kaz and Chris ordered &#8212; I just ate.<br />
I have to say that, so far, sushi isn&#8217;t much different than in Canada. It&#8217;s very tasty, and there are certainly things we don&#8217;t have, but the biggest differences are in size (portions are a lot larger), the wasabi is very fresh, and the rice is warm. This is because the fish doesn&#8217;t have to be frozen first.<br />
Eating our fill (which wasn&#8217;t too much) we proceeded to wander about Chiba a little. We ended up (on our way back to the station) at a place called Erotikave, a bar where the featured item is a bottle of Beefeater Gin with a rubber dildo affixed to the top. Rather odd&#8230;<br />
There we met one of Chris&#8217; friends, Shinichiro. He&#8217;s a freelance photographer, and a very funny guy. That&#8217;s when I realized just how good Chris&#8217; Japanese has become &#8212; he understands most things told to him, and can hold himself very well in a conversation. He&#8217;s not too bad in translating, either.<br />
Suddenly, it was a quarter to midnight. We had to bolt out to catch the last train to Yotsukaido. It was supposed to depart at 00:01, but was there until about 00:20. It was packed. I almost expected to see the guys with the white gloves.<br />
Yotsukaido was quiet when we arrived. The flood of returning passengers disappeared quickly, and we walked in quiet back towards Chris&#8217; flat. At least until we heard a very loud voice down one of the alleys.<br />
It was Jan. He had been thinking about coming out with us, but had instead been caught in a meeting. Afterwards, he&#8217;d gone home to get drunk and watch &#8220;Last of the Mohicans&#8221;. We caught him on a run to the local 7-11 to get some orange juice for the impending hangover.<br />
Returning to the flat, we prepared for bed. Kaz is off back to Toyohashi tomorrow, and Chris has to work at 13:30. I just want to get some sleep.<br />
I&#8217;ve had a very busy day.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, it&#8217;s Easter time again, and that means a lot of family events out here in the great Canadian plains. The major difference this year is what sort of family events we do. In previous years, it&#8217;s been a massive dinner (or series of dinners). This year, we did something a little different.<br />
We moved Nana from Prince Albert to Calgary.<br />
This was a move in the works for a long time. Nana has been unhappy staying in PA. It&#8217;s a long way from most of her family, and her circle of friends gets smaller with each passing year. While she&#8217;s not showing any signs of slowing down, even at the age of 90, there is always a need to change gears every now and then.<br />
So on Friday morning, I ventured out to my aunt and uncle&#8217;s house where I met up with my Uncle Mike (Aunt Brenda and my cousin Jen had gone out on the Sunday to help Nana finish packing). Mike, Maggie (their pet dalmatian), and I were following out with a moving truck. I was in for a long weekend&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;ve done the trip east in Alberta as far as Hanna (about two or so hours from Calgary). In fact, this is where I ended up chasing a train last year back to Drumheller. This time, however, I would continue east into Saskatchewan, through Kindersley, turning at Saskatoon, and then north to PA.<br />
It&#8217;s about an eight-hour drive. The last time I&#8217;d done an eight-hour drive anywhere was on my last road trip with Gerry (see 26 August 1997). I hadn&#8217;t driven for any major length of time through the prairies in a long while, and I was about to get a major refresher course.<br />
Out to Hanna, you spend a fair bit of time in the Badlands &#8212; not the deep Badlands, but the erosion does bring out the shapes and colours quite readily. After Hanna, it&#8217;s all prairie. Not as dead-flat as southern Saskatchewan or Alberta (or Kansas, for that matter), but it doesn&#8217;t take long to get lulled into a sense of &#8230; well, you fall asleep.<br />
I had a good excuse, though &#8212; I&#8217;d been out with friends seeing &#8220;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&#8221;, at a midnight showing. The movie was great, but I didn&#8217;t get to bed until almost 02:00 in the morning. A half-hour nap in the truck, though, and I was able to continue the trip.<br />
Our first major stop was at Kindersley, which also marked our halfway point. Lunch, water and a walk for Maggie, and we were on our way again.<br />
I kept myself occupied (when we weren&#8217;t babbling about whatever came to mind) by watching for trains. The highway we were on roughly paralleled one of CN&#8217;s lines &#8212; the one between Saskatoon and Calgary, to be specific. Even with the long drive, I didn&#8217;t see a single train. I didn&#8217;t happen to notice a couple of abandoned railbeds, though.<br />
We popped in at the southeastern corner of Saskatoon, very close to the Saskatoon train station that the CBC 50th Anniversary train had stopped (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Saskatoon]]). We didn&#8217;t pass by the station, and came in at 22nd Street and Circle Drive. Ironically enough, I had seen the new interchange before my uncle (we&#8217;d almost become lost driving back and forth from the train), and managed to direct him through it.<br />
I&#8217;ve driven from the Saskatoon Airport to PA many times. But I didn&#8217;t recognize any of the sights. None of the towns, none of the locations &#8212; nada. The unfamiliarity was actually a great distraction, mostly because Maggie recognized it, and new she&#8217;d be getting out of the truck soon.<br />
We arrived at Nana&#8217;s apartment around 16:00, which is pretty good time, I gather. Piling out of the truck, we went in and prepared to start packing. It was all done. The only outstanding parts were to disassemble the bed, load the truck, and leave. That wouldn&#8217;t been until the following morning. Instead, we rested from our long trip.<br />
That night, we enjoyed the last meal Nana would cook in her kitchen. Turkey, a personal favourite. We celebrated Maggie&#8217;s 10th birthday (complete with ice cream cake), and entertained a small army of visitors who came by to see the family.<br />
The next morning began early. Following a short breakfast from McDonald&#8217;s, I disassembled the bed and we moved it into the van. Nana had sold it to a friend, but it had to go into storage until they could pick it up. Storage in PA means the basement of a legal firm.<br />
When we returned, we immediately proceeded with the remainder of the packing. First item up: all the big stuff, starting with the china cabinet.<br />
This is how I got the second injury of the day (Mike got the first one when a nail in the wall opened a rather nasty gash on his hand). We were loading the cabinet into the truck (on its side &#8212; the cabinet wouldn&#8217;t fit in vertically), Mike on the high end any myself on the low end. Only Mike had his end a little too high, and it hit the top of the van. The cabinet stopped, but I kept going&#8230;<br />
WHAM!<br />
My face collided with the bottom of the cabinet. Luckily, my nose cushioned the impact. But not before creating a rather nice semi-circular cut on my nose. It took a while for it to stop bleeding, and the end result is, well, let&#8217;s just say that when people ask what happened, I tell them I got into a bar fight in PA.<br />
It sounds better than getting whacked in the schnozz with a china cabinet.<br />
In under two hours, we packed up everything Nana was taking into the van. A quick vacuum, and we were ready to leave. I expected a slow departure. This had been Nana&#8217;s home for 27 years. But there was no hesitation for her &#8212; it was time to move on with living. It was time to move to Calgary.<br />
Our three-car caravan hit the road at about 11:00 &#8212; Aunt Brenda in lead with the minivan, myself following in Nana&#8217;s car, and Mike bringing up the rear in the moving van. (The order would change not too far out of Kindersley &#8212; Mike wanted to get back a little more quickly than we were moving.)<br />
The trip back was fuelled by a steady supply of Coke. There was no way I was going to cross the prairies solo without being fully awake. I&#8217;ve nearly fallen asleep at the wheel enough to know that if you have to, you drink caffeine constantly.<br />
Aside from stopping in Saskatoon (for a quick bathroom break), our only other stops were in Kindersley for lunch, and somewhere around Alsask so we could refill our drink supply.<br />
We arrived in Calgary around 20:00. My back was killing me. Nana&#8217;s car had been comfortable for about four hours, but the seats were never designed for long trips. I needed to get out and walk a bit. We had the opportunity, since we also had to empty the car and part of the van.<br />
Bidding farewell for the evening, I walked back to the C-Train station, went home, and about near passed out from exhaustion.<br />
We emptied both vans the following day, with assistance from Pam and Sean. Our larger Easter dinner also featured the newly-returned Darren from Thailand. But the pain of the previous days&#8217; work was hard to overcome. Suffice to say, it&#8217;s a trip we won&#8217;t have to make again any time soon.<br />
Which is good, &#8216;cuz I still have a buzz from all the Coke.</p>
