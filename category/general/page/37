	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a long day.<br />
It all started about a week ago. One of our clients, whom I&#8217;m afraid I cannot mention, had a problem with the website we developed for them. Actually, it wasn&#8217;t the client so much as it was our so-called partner in crime.<br />
Critical Mass typically designs the front-end &#8212; all the pretty pictures and clicky things &#8212; of a website. Typically, someone else does the back-end &#8212; all the junk that deals with the ecommerce and database. This isn&#8217;t our idea &#8212; it&#8217;s usually the client&#8217;s. We don&#8217;t much cotton to that process; it lends to more problems than it&#8217;s worth. That&#8217;s how I ended up here in Cincinnati.<br />
We provided one of our stunning works of art to the client, who then turned it over to the backend developers (whom, again, I cannot mention). The firm is large, and we assumed technically savvy. We should know better.<br />
They fubared the site. Lemme back up &#8212; they tried to merge our site with their backend, and then claimed that our &#8220;monkey s&#8211;t JavaScript&#8221; didn&#8217;t work. That&#8217;s a load of bally-hoo &#8212; we wouldn&#8217;t have shipped it if it didn&#8217;t work. Then we got the email that drove most of us in Web Development off the deep end&#8230;<br />
We develop our sites with the most recent developments in HTML, including JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). One of our favourite tricks is to build everything in &#8220;layers&#8221; &#8212; small pieces we can stack on top of each other. It makes the site very flexible. This technique is what was causing the backend consultants grief.<br />
The backend (using a system called Dynamo) wasn&#8217;t working with our layers (specifically, a tag called a &#8220;DIV&#8221;). So they decided that we could no longer develop using DIV tags, and had to build everything with tables. Uhhhhh, no.<br />
We thought this was a load of crock from the moment we first heard it. We knew that our code was solid &#8212; we&#8217;d built several sites using Dynamo and DIVs, and never had a problem. So we told them that. They didn&#8217;t exactly listen. I wrote up a small quasi-manifesto (with some contributions from Adile, my partner in crime in my first project at Critical Mass). I figure that&#8217;s how I ended up here.<br />
On Friday, just after lunch, Nancy (the account manager for this particular client) drew me aside and asked if I would go to Cincinnati and clear this mess up. Big responsibility. No, I wasn&#8217;t the best choice &#8212; there are others in the company who were far better suited to this problem &#8212; but I was the best choice of the available people.<br />
Simply put, there were about five people Nancy would have sent. Two were far too tied up on projects to pull off. One was, well, we were worried that they would back down and give into the consultant&#8217;s demands to convert the entire site to tables. Another would have been ideal, but would probably get into too many arguments to be truly effective. That left me. Being between projects, and having some experience with Dynamo and DIVs, I got fingered to go.<br />
This morning, I was running around like a madman, trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible. The flight still hadn&#8217;t been booked (nor the hotel), I hadn&#8217;t packed (owing to a lack of a suitably-sized duffel bag), I needed to set up email forwarding, get files copied to the laptop (which had only just returned from Cincinnati), I had to square away rent (just in case I don&#8217;t get back before the beginning of the month), and I had to pay a couple of bills. All that before 11:00.<br />
I left at 11:40 for the airport. The flight was at 2:05 on Northwest Airlines. I would fly from Calgary to Minneapolis/St. Paul, where I&#8217;d catch a connecting flight to Cincinnati. (Oh the joys of the airline hub.) I arrived at Calgary airport in sufficient time to check-in and get lunch.<br />
I&#8217;ve never flown Northwest before. I don&#8217;t like American airlines in general, and I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having to take one. But when given no choice, you take what you&#8217;re given. That&#8217;s why when I found out that my ticket automatically upgraded me to First Class, I didn&#8217;t refuse.<br />
I didn&#8217;t check any bags &#8212; I prefer not to, just so I don&#8217;t have to deal with baggage pick-up at the other end. Customs was fun. The game was &#8220;Let&#8217;s See If We Can Freak Geoff Out&#8221;. The questions came fast and hard, and I responded just as quickly. Then I goofed. When asked for the duration of my stay, I said I hoped to return on Sunday. &#8220;Hoped.&#8221; Bad choice of word. This brought up a whole issue of why I wouldn&#8217;t be coming back on Sunday. That escalated into the purpose of my visit, and what exactly was I doing there. I figured it would snowball into &#8220;Why can&#8217;t an American do this?&#8221; &#8212; luckily, it didn&#8217;t.<br />
The flight was late, by about 30 minutes or so. Soon we were called, and I walked down the gangway to our DC-9. I can&#8217;t tell you the last time I&#8217;d flown in a DC-9, only that it&#8217;s been a very long time. I had 3C, and the adjoining 3A, all to myself. Wow. Big seats. Nice service. Free booze. Too bad I&#8217;m trying not to drink (I get dehydrated enough as it is on planes without having alcohol).<br />
It was about three hours to Minneapolis. During the time, we were served lunch &#8212; a chicken sandwich. But in First Class, the sandwich is nice and hot, with yummy cheese and grilled peppers. It comes with a nice little salad, and an Italian rolled ice cream ball.<br />
I like First Class.<br />
You also get a GLASS glass for your drink, instead of some goofy plastic cup. It really does make a difference.<br />
We arrived in Minneapolis around 5:45pm (local time). I was supposed to go to Gate 7, where I&#8217;d catch my connecting flight at 7:00. So of course, we came in at Gate 64. Figures. I hiked across the airport (and boy, is it a big airport), and found my way to Gate 7. There, I plunked myself down, and continued to teach myself Dynamo. (Not having a manual makes it kinda hard.)<br />
Around 6:30, I began to wonder why Gate 7 didn&#8217;t have any sign up for my flight. Gate 8, which was leaving for Green Bay at 7:15, had its sign up before I got there. I started to wonder. So I asked.<br />
Attendant: &#8220;Yeah, your flight is leaving from Gate Sev&#8230; er, they&#8217;ve moved it.&#8221;<br />
Me: &#8220;Where to?&#8221; (I already knew the answer. Murphy was standing right behind me.)<br />
Attendant: &#8220;Gate 82.&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;ll tell you one thing &#8212; I&#8217;m glad that I started working out (although I&#8217;ve been a little lax in the past week or two). By the time I got to Gate 82, I was winded. Of course, I was hiking at a serious pace to get there on time.<br />
Flight 8530 was being operated by Mesaba Airlines. I haven&#8217;t heard of &#8217;em, either. Frankly, that worried me, too. But as it turns out, they just operate Northwest&#8217;s regional flights. Supposedly, Cincinnati is regional from Minneapolis.<br />
We flew an RJ-45, er, 85 (sorry, techie joke there). I&#8217;ve never heard of an RJ-85, I don&#8217;t even know who built the silly thing. It looks kind of like a cross between a Harrier Jumpjet and a 747. Very strange. Holds about 69 people. Flies like a kite &#8212; sways all over the bloody place.<br />
The meal was another sandwich &#8212; turkey, this time. No ice cream, though. We got a gourmet cookie instead. Whee. This time I had a rowmate, a guy from Cisco Systems. We engaged in hearty conversation in the last 20 minutes or so of the flight, recounting our views of Digital Equipment, and how we realized that they were doomed long before Compaq bought &#8217;em out.<br />
I&#8217;d forgotten how humid it gets out here (in the East, that is). Calgary is dry &#8212; it&#8217;s like walking through a lake out here (comparatively speaking, of course). I sweltered the entire way downtown to the Omni Netherlands.<br />
Nathan, who&#8217;d only recently returned to Calgary from here, complained that the Omni&#8217;s rooms were &#8220;small&#8221;. I could easily hold a small concert in my room. I hate to know what he thinks &#8220;big&#8221; is.<br />
Well, I&#8217;m off to bed now. I&#8217;ve got a long day tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. It&#8217;s going to be a long week&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My time here in Calgary is finite. I&#8217;m not staying here forever. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like this city &#8212; but there&#8217;s more to this planet than a single settlement near the foot of the Canadian Rockies.<br />
When I first arrived here in Calgary, most you all received a message from me letting you know what had just happened. One of the replies struck me with a fair bit of interest, partly because at that point I was a little bewildered with what I&#8217;d done, and my sensibilities were left behind in Vancouver, and partly because I was feeling quite a bit of exhilaration from being free. It went something like this:<br />
&#8220;So. Now you have your life ahead of you. [&#8230;] Let me extend the very sincere invitation to accompany me to go to Japan. Yes, I am being serious. [&#8230;] Besides the fact that we are english speaking north americans [sic], we have computer skills too, which adds up to equal a [&#8230;] load of money for us (and a lot of REALLY good stories to tell our friends). [&#8230;] If I had to share a 4&#215;4 shoebox with anybody, you would be a good choice.&#8221;<br />
This was from my friend Chris, whom I&#8217;ve known since the first day in Mr. Gettsinger&#8217;s Grade 10 Math class. Stuart, Chris, and I had been mostly inseparable through high school (Stuart and I shared a locker for most of high school). Chris and I have the same birthday (we still haven&#8217;t figured out who&#8217;s actually the elder, though given the odds, it&#8217;s probably Chris &#8212; I was born towards the last quarter of the day). We share a mutual love of movies (as do several of our other friends), and a twisted sense of humour.<br />
Now we share an apartment. This is part of our Master Plan. In a little over a year, the two of us are going to Japan. For Chris, this is to satisfy his obsession with all things Japanese. For me, this is to satisfy my curiosity. Sounds like a little much to go through for curiosity, doesn&#8217;t it? Don&#8217;t blame me &#8212; blame my grandmother.<br />
Beatrice Sowrey travelled all around the world, visiting every continent (except Antarctica) before she died in late 1995. She seemed to have a gene that made her want to travel and see things. She passed that gene to my father, who with my mother, has been around quite a lot. That gene is now in my blood. Although I haven&#8217;t been to as many places as my predecessors, that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t have the urge.<br />
That&#8217;s what Chris being here is all about. This is Phase 1. We&#8217;re going to be here for a year, to pay bills and save money. Then we&#8217;re off to Japan. Calgary is a convenient location &#8212; cheap rent, reasonably good salaries, close proximity to Vancouver (the &#8220;Gateway to the Pacific&#8221;).<br />
Phase 1 started Saturday, when I got up to watch cartoons. Okay, not right then, but shortly thereafter, when I got down to cleaning the apartment. Top to bottom &#8212; vacuumed, swept, mopped, and rearranged. Everything was ready for Chris&#8217; arrival.<br />
His plane landed around 5:45pm, about the time I got to the airport (his flight was early). Stuart and Therese were already there, ready to meet Chris with me. (In my later-than-planned arrival, I ended up calling Stuart on the cell phone trying to make sure I was in the right place, only to end up looking right at him while talking on the cell phone. Doh.)<br />
After picking up his bags, I hauled him to his new home for a while. We would meet up with Therese and Stuart afterwards at Therese&#8217;s friend Janine&#8217;s, where she was holding a house-warming party for her new abode.<br />
The party consisted of about 10 people, a little over half of whom I knew. It was a somewhat subdued affair, where we all sat around, ate and drank (some more than others). After a while, the younger ones in the crowd (of whom, I&#8217;m sorry to say, I ain&#8217;t one) spoke up, wanting to go out clubbing.<br />
Janine&#8217;s place is not even a block from the club strip on 4th Street. It didn&#8217;t take long to find a place. Only that after a few minutes, we began to wonder if we&#8217;d all make it in. Chris and I, opting more for comfort than style, were wearing clothes that we suspected the bouncer would reject as not &#8220;trendy enough&#8221;. (Yeah, I know, this sounds really weird for Calgary &#8230; I guess it happens everywhere.)<br />
Stop #2 was at Cherry, a club not far away. Small &#8230; really small. Somewhat claustrophobic. We wandered around a little and tried to talk above the &#8220;music&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t long before most of us disappeared onto the dance floor. Stuart, Therese, and I opted to hang back in the upper decks, watching the crowd below.<br />
That&#8217;s when things started to go wrong for me. I started feeling angry. Really angry. To the point where I was ready to beat something (or someone) into a pulp. It was unsettling, to say the least. I couldn&#8217;t stop it.<br />
Luckily, I had my psychologist next to me, who promptly tried to help me through it. It didn&#8217;t help much. I was a little too unravelled at that moment to be coherent, let alone fully conscious of what was going on. I nearly broke down into tears. I hate mood swings.<br />
The rest of the night, I didn&#8217;t feel right. I didn&#8217;t feel right until late Sunday, when something finally clicked. I was lying in bed, trying to find the root of my anxieties. All weekend, since Chris arrived, I&#8217;d been feeling uptight, nervous, defensive. Like a light going on in the room, I suddenly knew why.<br />
I&#8217;m cohabitating again.<br />
All the pain that I&#8217;d been accumulating for the past two years was working it&#8217;s way back. I was thinking of Chris in the same way I&#8217;d thought of Allison. Bad &#8230; very, very bad. I actually had to remind myself that Chris is my roommate and one of my best friends. Not someone I had run away from.<br />
I haven&#8217;t had a roommate since 1996. At least not one where I could go off and do my own thing, and no-one else cared. So I have some adjustments to make. They&#8217;ll come. Realizing what was wrong has certainly helped.<br />
In the meantime, Chris and I are getting ourselves settled &#8212; Chris is getting a job, and I&#8217;m getting used to having someone else around all the time &#8212; and then we&#8217;ll start the arduous process of figuring out how the heck to get to the other side of the Pacific.<br />
But we&#8217;ve got a year to figure that out.<br />
In the meantime, I&#8217;m getting myself ready &#8212; I&#8217;m preparing for the inevitable culture shock, and getting my website overhauled.<br />
The culture shock is the hard one. I watched &#8220;Ghost In The Shell&#8221; the other night &#8212; it&#8217;s a Japanese adult animated movie &#8212; a genre often referred to as &#8220;anime&#8221;. (I say &#8220;adult&#8221; because it&#8217;s not for kids &#8212; there&#8217;s swearing, violence, and yes, even some nudity. But it&#8217;s a good movie &#8212; Gene Siskel gave it &#8220;thumbs up&#8221;.)<br />
Now, it&#8217;s not the best way to experience Japan (that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re going there), but if you let yourself sink into the environment of the movie (which isn&#8217;t too hard &#8212; there&#8217;s a few slow points), you can get even a partial idea of what you&#8217;re going to see.<br />
That scared me.<br />
I was actually *frightened*. I have no idea why. Usually these things get me excited. I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not just going to a different country, I&#8217;m going to a different culture, a different language, and an entirely different alphabet. (Yeah, I know that sounds kinda dumb &#8212; the Soviet Union had a different alphabet, too, but at least it transferred to the phonetic alphabet without too much difficulty.)<br />
The obvious question is &#8212; am I afraid to go to Japan? The answer is &#8220;no&#8221;. I think it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m looking at a culture that, really, I know little about. In order to know a culture, you have to immerse yourself in it. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going. I think it&#8217;s the fear of being an outsider (which we&#8217;ll be &#8212; no amount of preparation will counter that) that gave me the jitters. Hopefully that&#8217;s something that will go away with time.<br />
As for my website, well, that&#8217;s to be expected (me overhauling again, that is), isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m a ways from releasing it &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of work to do before I can put it up. And it&#8217;s not all going to be done right away &#8212; I&#8217;m eventually putting the whole thing in a database, and that&#8217;ll take a while before it&#8217;s ready. Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; I&#8217;ll let you know when I release it.<br />
In the meantime, you can look at another piece of my work. No, nothing I&#8217;ve done for Critical Mass (yet &#8212; I have to wait for those sites to be launched), but something I&#8217;ve done for a friend: <a href="http://www.deskcam.net/">http://www.deskcam.net</a>.<br />
One of my Radical friends created a cool little application that captures images from web-based cameras and puts it on your desktop. You can even make little (or large) movies from it. Very slick little app.<br />
There, that&#8217;s my commercial plug for the day. Hmm&#8230; maybe I should look for corporate sponsorship&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend saw the first league tournament of the season. Frankly, I couldn&#8217;t quite figure out why we had a tournament so early in the year (we&#8217;ve had TWO regular season games so far, both on the same day). But I wasn&#8217;t about to turn down the ability to go out and get some more practice.<br />
Goodness knows I need it.<br />
Our first game was Friday evening up in the Northeast at Lester B. Pearson High School (a bare hop-skip-and-jump from my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s), against a team called the Screwballs. Oddly enough, of the three games we played this weekend, theirs is the only one whose name I remember.<br />
We almost had to forfeit due to lack of players. It wasn&#8217;t a problem of not enough women, we didn&#8217;t have enough guys. Luckily, the rest showed up just as we started the game. It was a chilly evening, so I was quite happy to play right field, where I would be at least somewhat mobile.<br />
The first inning went more-or-less uneventful &#8212; no major screwups on our part, no major offensive on their part. The second inning brought my first at bat. Memories of our first two games hung heavily with me. I was dreading another strike out. I hadn&#8217;t had the chance to get to a batting cage (and so I&#8217;ve found out since then, they ain&#8217;t cheap, so I&#8217;ll be going sparingly when I actually get around to going). I was, shall we say, apprehensive.<br />
Looking at the selection of bats, I noticed that there was a new bat. I&#8217;d tried all the previous three bats, all without success. I figured that I couldn&#8217;t possibly do any worse with the new bat.<br />
The first pitch looked good. Figuring that I was going to miss it anyway, I swung. A peculiar feeling vibrated through the bat handle a fraction of a moment later, and I found myself wondering what just happened. I looked up to see a small off-white sphere sailing away from where the bat had just been. The now-familiar &#8220;plack!&#8221; sound the ball usually made when it landed on the mat was not to be heard. Using my powerful deductive reasoning, I came to the (rather surprising) conclusion that I&#8217;d actually hit the ball.<br />
Who &#8216;da thunk it?<br />
That&#8217;s when I heard the voices. &#8220;Run!&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t my team yelling at me &#8212; it was the ones in my head. (Relax, I haven&#8217;t gone insane. I&#8217;ll explain in a moment.) I bolted to first as fast as my legs, which clearly weren&#8217;t ready for the sudden motion, could take me. There was no way I was going to make it to second, so I held tight.<br />
Needless to say, I was rather amazed with myself. Not so much that it was a good hit (it passed over the shortstop&#8217;s outstretched (with a good jump) glove by mere inches), but that I hit it at all. Little did I know what was happening to me.<br />
(I would hit every single time at bat for the rest of the weekend &#8212; only once would I not make it to base. Every time, it was with that bat &#8212; a Louisville Slugger. I love that bat.)<br />
The inning ended, sadly, with me stranded on second. Well, I was on my way to third, but the batter was caught out.<br />
Returning to right field, I began to sit back into waiting. Right field, especially in this league, is quiet. Not much happens out there. (Now that I&#8217;ve said that, I&#8217;ll be inundated with pop flies for the rest of the season.)<br />
The first batter up collided with the ball sort of like a Howitzer &#8230; into right field. (He was a lefty, it was half-expected.) Last year, I missed a lot of these shots. For some reason, I was always too short. (Short as in I wasn&#8217;t far enough out in the field.) I could see the ball arcing towards me, and all I kept thinking was: &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna miss this.&#8221;<br />
Then I heard the voices.<br />
&#8220;Take a couple steps back.&#8221;<br />
So I did. Suddenly, I realized that I was under it. I adjusted my footing so that I was right under it. Next thing I knew, the ball was in my glove. I paused a brief moment until the shock wore off. I threw the ball to the second baser, but there was no rush &#8212; there were no other runners.<br />
While I waited for the next batter, I stood there trying to figure out what the heck had just happened. I was puzzled beyond belief.<br />
You see, I&#8217;d heard the voices before. On last Monday&#8217;s games, I kept hearing things like &#8220;Run&#8221;, &#8220;Hold up&#8221;, &#8220;Bend and scoop&#8221;, and &#8220;Stab at the ball&#8221;. Yet no-one on my team was telling me these things.<br />
At first, I thought it was just me. But standing out there in right field, one gets a fair bit of time to think, reflect, self search, and wonder. In that inning, I had an epiphany. Like being broad-sided with a battleship, I abruptly realized what was happening. I didn&#8217;t have (and still don&#8217;t have) a mentor on the team. But I don&#8217;t need one &#8212; I&#8217;ve got my mentors from last year. Every word of advice they ever told me is coming back.<br />
It&#8217;s sort of like when you make a stew or chili. If you try and eat it right away, it&#8217;s okay, but not great. You have to let it sit and let all the flavours blend. During the six-plus months off, all the advice I got starting sinking in. Like someone turning a light on in a dark room, I knew where the voices were coming from.<br />
As you can guess, I was quite happy to figure this out &#8230; I was beginning to worry for a while.<br />
Now this hasn&#8217;t turned me into Sammy Sosa &#8212; but I&#8217;ve noticed that I&#8217;m playing significantly better than last year. Either that, or the team (and the league) is significantly worse than last year&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Despite my apparent improvement, we were unable to defeat our opposing team. However, we lost by only a couple of runs. This, believe it or not, is a very positive thing. It showed that despite only one practice (which I missed) and two games (one of which we one), we weren&#8217;t doing too badly.<br />
That didn&#8217;t stop us from engaging in another practice. Those of us who weren&#8217;t in a rush to take off stuck around for an impromptu ball-catching session. The voices kept telling me what to do (&#8220;Dive&#8221;, &#8220;Step Back&#8221;, &#8220;Run In&#8221;, &#8220;LOOK OUT!!&#8221;), and I kept catching the balls. It was almost like someone had me on remote control. It was actually kinda creepy.<br />
My alarm went off at 6:00 the following morning. I ignored it until the second alarm went off at 6:30. Because we&#8217;d lost the previous night, our first game was at 8:00 at the Deerfoot Athletic Park at Deerfoot and 16th Ave NW.<br />
One look out the window told me what it wasn&#8217;t going to be a warm day. It looked cold. There was no reason for me to think that, but it looked cold. Sure enough, a check of the thermometer (on TV) told me that it was cold &#8212; it was definitely a morning for sweats.<br />
I arrived at the field not long after Ken, our coach. We found our field, and started to wait for the rest of the team. They slowly started accumulating after a little while, the rest of us shivering in the cold. When the equipment finally arrived, several of us immediately began warming up.<br />
The sun poked into the field about 20 minutes after we started, and as the right fielder, I was in a prime position to take its full warmth. Even then, I was still cold. It wasn&#8217;t until after a couple of innings that I was warm enough to even unzip the collar on my sweatshirt.<br />
The game was tough and tight &#8212; we were about evenly matched. Except that we were one player short. We need 10 people on a team (the tenth person is a &#8220;rover&#8221;, someone who can run throughout the outfield, supporting the other fielders). We had only nine. This meant we had to take an automatic out every rotation of the batting order. It was a shortage that would cost us dearly.<br />
Tight as the game was, we came up two runs short. And no, the final score wasn&#8217;t 2-0. It was 10-8. That&#8217;s how well we played. Hearing voices in my head was becoming a handy thing to have.<br />
Our next game wasn&#8217;t until 12:30, so I opted to head downtown and do some work. Not real work, of course, but something for fun. I&#8217;m developing a website for a good friend of mine, who has a very cool product. It gets launched next Monday &#8212; maybe I&#8217;ll let you know! I was a little behind on my work on that, so I figured I&#8217;d make use of the downtime and start plugging away.<br />
As I wrote HTML and tweaked images, I could see the bright sunshine outside. I figured our next game would be nice, and I could finally strip down to my shorts. I should know better than that&#8230;<br />
When I got back to Deerfoot Athletic Park, the sky was cloudy, the wind blowing harder, and it seemed even colder than in the morning. I was the first to arrive, and I watched as two teams battled for the chance to play again later in the day.<br />
Our team assembled, even with a couple of spares for a change, and prepared to take the field. I took right field, as usual, and started freezing to death. It wasn&#8217;t much above zero (as was fully shown when it snowed in the fourth inning).<br />
In fact, it was so cold the voices shivered. Luckily, I was still able to play reasonably well. But even if we had all played in top-notch form, we could not have held back the onslaught. We were outmatched, and it wasn&#8217;t by a small margin. Final score: 22-8.<br />
Losing by that much when you play poorly isn&#8217;t such a bad loss &#8212; you kind of expect it. Losing by that much when you put everything you have into the game is just downright demoralizing.<br />
Tonight, we&#8217;re back at the game for another doubleheader. (All our play dates this year are doubleheaders, for some stupid reason.) My shin is still a little stiff from Saturday, but with luck I&#8217;ll be able to play.<br />
Just so long as I have the voices to keep me company in right field.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The goats are being sucked.&#8221;<br />
Many of you will stare at the screen and wonder what the heck that means. Others of you will nod in recognition. For the benefit of those who have no idea what that quote means, &#8220;Don&#8217;t suck goats!&#8221; was the Rad Sox&#8217; battle cry last year just before taking to the field.<br />
Yesterday was my new team&#8217;s first foray onto the diamond. I play with one of two company softball teams. There were 40 people who turned out this year, so we made up two separate teams. One, called the Cooters (got me on the meaning of this one), and the one I play for &#8212; the Base HREFs. Never let HTML developers try to come up with punny names. They can&#8217;t.<br />
I was a late joiner. During my interview at Critical Mass back in early March, I saw a sign-up sheet for the softball team. Thinking that this would be a good way to get me out, I made myself remember the sign was there for when I was hired. (Yes, I was optimistic.) Sure enough, I got myself onto the team within a few days of starting here.<br />
Because I was a late joiner, and because there were already 20 people on each team, I was accidentally missed from the first batch of email, one of which listed the first (and so far only) practice. That said, I made it out to last night&#8217;s games (we had a double-header), complete with a jersey (left over from last year).<br />
This year is going to be difficult. I know only a couple of people on the team. Our captain, Ken, knows the rules, but he&#8217;s not a tenth as cool (nor does he possess the attitude) as Lee, the Rad Sox&#8217; &#8220;Fearless Leader&#8221;. There&#8217;s no star player jackrabbitting around the outfield. And I have no mentor this year to correct my plethora of bad habits &#8212; the gap Neall filled is quite large, as was evident by last night&#8217;s games.<br />
The first game was against ourselves, or rather, the other CMass team. This was going to make for interesting water cooler conversation and stairwell banter &#8212; to the loser would go the ignominy of defeat, to the winner the right to brag for the rest of the year. So needless to say, we all played horribly.<br />
There were shining points &#8212; both teams had their rallies while the outfield scrambled madly to catch fly balls, and the infield shut down runners with Terminator-like efficiency. There were also the downpoints &#8230; like my batting. I didn&#8217;t hit a darn thing all night. Nada. Sqwat. In fact, I *think* I *might* have actually disturbed the ball&#8217;s wake once. Struck out every time I went up. At least last year I tended to hit the ball more often than not.<br />
I need to spend an afternoon in a batting cage&#8230;<br />
I will say one thing about the fields in Calgary &#8212; like the Prairies, they&#8217;re flat. It&#8217;s great. No worries about a fast rolling ball suddenly flying up into your schnoz. I&#8217;m not really looking forward to reliving last year&#8217;s little injury.<br />
The game lasted only seven innings &#8212; we had a double-header, and the sun sets just after 9:00, leaving only about three hours of play. Both teams played hard, and for a while, I thought we were losing (rather badly) to the other team. But in the bottom of the seventh (we were up at bat), I was surprised to find out that we were only three runs down. Then it was two &#8230; one &#8230; and then tied. We ended the game with a final run.<br />
Then the dispute began. The Cooters believed that we had miscounted, believing they were six runs ahead. Name calling and insults &#8212; the usual interoffice banter &#8212; erupted around the diamond while the score keepers sorted the mess out. Despite the loud by-the-books manager of the Cooters (who I&#8217;m told is the CEO&#8217;s brother), they missed an entire inning of runs. We hailed victorious.<br />
Somehow, I&#8217;ve got the feeling that&#8217;s the only win we&#8217;ll see this season.<br />
The second game was &#8230; well, I was going to put in a neat little literary description to give you an idea of how badly we lost. The only problem is I can&#8217;t think of one good enough to convey such an utter defeat. The only thing that comes close is Napoleon&#8217;s naval defeat in Aboukir Bay by Admiral Horatio Nelson in 1798. Nelson claimed &#8220;there is no word to describe such an utter victory&#8221;. It was the most decisive battle in naval history.<br />
No, I didn&#8217;t just pluck that little fact out of my head &#8212; living on my own, I&#8217;ve had a bit of time to watch TV, and I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of The Learning Channel lately. They had a show on Napoleon&#8217;s Obsession with Egypt &#8212; quite a fascinating show. I can certainly understand why Napoleon was so revered. (Perhaps more interesting was another TLC show that told the story of Napoleon&#8217;s murder many years later on the island of St. Helena.)<br />
Okay, so I&#8217;m a geek with lots of useless trivia. Let&#8217;s just say that I&#8217;ve never needed to use a lifeline on &#8220;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire&#8221;. Not that I watch the show with any regularity at all. In fact, I think I&#8217;ve seen parts of about seven episodes. I usually turn the channel because I end up screaming at the guy who can&#8217;t remember if Humpty Dumpty fell of a wall or a horse.<br />
I played right field during both games. In the first game, I was bored. The Cooters are all right-handed batters. But The Screwballs (the second time) not only had left-handed batters, but had people who could place hits. I was running all over the place. That&#8217;s how I got injured.<br />
Relax, no blood loss. I was sprinting after a shot (that I should have caught), but as usual I was too shallow. Realizing this, I quickly pivoted to lunge and catch it. Only problem was that while my body was turning, my right leg decided to mutiny. I somehow ended up wrenching my quadricep. I barely made it through the inning, and ended up sitting out the rest of the game.<br />
Today, I&#8217;m sore. That&#8217;s to be expected, I guess. I haven&#8217;t played in about nine months. But I&#8217;m not as bad as I thought I would be. I&#8217;m going to the batting cages &#8212; I&#8217;m in dire need of practice. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll do better in this weekend&#8217;s tournament.<br />
You can all stop laughing now.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Years ago, Easter weekend meant a trip to my grandmother&#8217;s in Toronto for a dinner with the rest of the family. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;d been in a large family gathering for Easter, but this year certainly did put a new spin on everything.<br />
I&#8217;ll get to that in a moment or two.<br />
Friday morning started slowly for me. Usually, I&#8217;m up around 6:00 (sometimes as late at 6:30, if I manage to completely out-sleep my alarm clock), and I start to get ready for work. Recently, it&#8217;s included a trip down to the pool for 30 minutes of swimming (although I have yet to reach 30 minutes, I&#8217;m wiped out after just over 20 &#8212; I figure it&#8217;s going to take me a while before I&#8217;m even close to being in the same shape I was in high school). Then it&#8217;s a shower, make lunch, and head out.<br />
Friday morning, I didn&#8217;t get up until 9am. I would&#8217;ve slept later, but the light in my room was overpowering. At least I didn&#8217;t wake up to an alarm clock. I skipped the morning swim.<br />
One of the things on my agenda was attempting to clean the apartment. It&#8217;s been on the agenda almost since I moved in, but you&#8217;d be surprised at the lack of motivation to do that. Dunno why.<br />
I watched TV for a while, before moving a few things around. The impact was negligible. Around 11:30, I decided to call Adile, one of my co-workers (and rapidly becoming a good friend). Adile&#8217;s an interesting character, to say the least. He&#8217;s 23 (aside from Rob, who sits next to me, I think I&#8217;m the second oldest in my department), has a masters in Palaeontology (he was working on a PhD before his funding ran out), and is a wizard with bizarre HTML layouts.<br />
He also had a wad of furniture he wants to sell. A couch (made by Sealy), a matching loveseat, coffee table, dresser, and a desk. All for $200. Needless to say, I&#8217;m mildly interested.<br />
We&#8217;d arranged the day before that he&#8217;d call me and we&#8217;d arrange a time for me to drop over. But after 11:30, I thought I&#8217;d check with him before trying to plan the rest of my day. (It&#8217;s a pain in the neck trying to figure out what to do when the person you want to get a hold of isn&#8217;t getting a hold of you.) He was still asleep. I remember being able to do that. He said he&#8217;d call me later, so I took the opportunity to do something else.<br />
I went to work.<br />
Relax, I didn&#8217;t actually do any work &#8230; at least not *work* work. I did my own thing. I&#8217;m helping a friend of mine with a website. It&#8217;s good practice for me. It also gave me a chance to read email (I actually get more email here than I did at Radical &#8230; and I dreaded coming back from vacation at Radical, reading email took hours).<br />
Around 3:00, Adile finally called me and said I could drop by. I hopped in the car and made a beeline (as much a beeline as can be made in some of Calgary&#8217;s hurly-burly subdivisions) for Adile&#8217;s home. Adile still lives with his parents (I make no comments on that, for I did the same thing until I was 25) in Ranchlands, not far from where Stuart and Therese live.<br />
The couch was an off-white, though parts of it were more off-white than others. It&#8217;s well-used, but not in bad shape. I looked at it carefully, and it didn&#8217;t look too bad. Even if it did get a little unsightly, a quick drop sheet eliminates that problem. Of course, this is still something I need to throw by my future roommate and see what he thinks.<br />
I quickly returned to my apartment to shower and make myself presentable &#8212; Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike had invited me to Easter dinner at Chez Znack. Before leaving Ranchlands, I stopped briefly at Crowfoot Village to pick up a 12 pack of Sleeman&#8217;s and a couple of bottles of wine (partly for dinner, and partly for partial payment for all my Aunt and Uncle have done for me).<br />
I arrived in Whitehorn just after 5:00. Uncle Mike was out front adjusting the lawn sprinkler (spring has sprung here in Calgary, despite a few naysayers who keep predicting a &#8220;big dump&#8221;). Maggie (their Dalmatian) looked happy to see me.<br />
The kitchen renovation was still in progress, though the trickiest part of the work was complete. When last I&#8217;d seen the kitchen, the counters were reduced to plywood, awaiting a layer of tiles. The tiles were now on the counter, though they had yet to be grouted. Tiles also adorned the walls in a backsplash following the length of the counter. It looked wonderful. The tiles are 6&#215;6, coloured almost a sandy-grey. Some of the wall tiles are decorative, and add a nice touch to the design. It will be really interesting to see what the kitchen looks like when it&#8217;s done.<br />
We were served fried scallops as appetizers. I&#8217;m finding I&#8217;ll eat most seafood now, though it all seems to taste the same. I have a sneaky suspicion that it won&#8217;t be long before I&#8217;m eat (shudder) lobster. We&#8217;ll see&#8230;<br />
Between the appetizer and dinner, my phone rang. It was Greg Mayer, one of my friends and former co-workers from Radical Entertainment. He was in Calgary for the weekend visiting relatives, and we had made rough plans to get together during the weekend. We talked briefly, setting up a tentative time for the following day.<br />
Dinner was turkey. I was looking forward to turkey. I love turkey. Especially with turkey gravy. On mashed potatoes. Mmmmm. And stuffing. Double mmmmm.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we finished dinner (with Jen rushing off to play her video game, pausing only long enough to ask me to come down and play with her when I was done). Turkey coma wasn&#8217;t far off&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Turkey coma&#8221;, for those of you who&#8217;ve never heard of it, is Stuart&#8217;s term for the sleepiness that sets in after a good turkey dinner. A lot of people dismiss it as having eaten too much. In reality, it&#8217;s the turkey. There&#8217;s a chemical in turkey meat that acts like a natural sedative &#8212; it makes you sleepy. The more you eat, the sleepier you get. (And having wine with the meal really doesn&#8217;t help matters much.)<br />
Just as I was about to go downstairs and join Jen in her video game, Aunt Brenda handed me a little gift &#8212; a set of frying pans. Just when I&#8217;d thought I was about to start paying them back for everything they did for me, they had to go and do something else nice for me. Like I said before, I love my family &#8230; even if I do feel like I&#8217;m going to be forever in their debt.<br />
When I got downstairs, Jen was in the middle of playing her rented copy of Super Smash Brothers. There are some games where I can actually beat Jen. This ain&#8217;t one of &#8217;em. As a team, we were unbeatable &#8230; though she could have won the match on her own. Against her, well, &#8220;total slaughter&#8221; comes to mind. She&#8217;d been playing all week, and I hadn&#8217;t. I got in a few good hits, but I was no match.<br />
I decided it was time to leave when I noticed that Aunt Brenda had succumbed to Turkey Coma (she had been overseeing the carnage). Frying pans in tow, I returned to the sanctity of downtown Calgary.<br />
I rose just after 9:00 on Saturday, again forced awake by the bright sun. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I rather like it this way. The sun is certainly a more preferable way to rise in the morning.<br />
My early wakening also afforded me the luxury of doing something I haven&#8217;t done since before I went to university &#8212; watch Saturday Morning cartoons. Although I watched them until noon, I didn&#8217;t get the same pleasure. Probably because most of them seem to be either Pokemon or Digimon. Nothing like the ones I watched when I was a kid: Blackstar, The Smurfs, Thundarr the Barbarian, Spiderman and His Amazing Friends, Pac Man, Alvin and the Chipmunks, He Man, Droids, Ewoks &#8230; the list is literally endless (I watched a lot of cartoons). Although Fox is bringing back Dungeons and Dragons @ 10:30 PST next Saturday.<br />
Sometime after noon, Greg called. He was ready to get together. I still had to run through the shower, and I had to pick him up. Originally, I had hoped that Torre (another of my former co-workers, Torre left Radical just days after me (though I suspect his reasons for leaving weren&#8217;t as dire as my own) and has landed in Calgary) might join us, but Greg told me Torre was entertaining friends. I&#8217;ll have to make sure I call Torre up soon.<br />
Greg told me where he was, and the basic direction I needed go. Looking at the map, it looked pretty easy.<br />
After being in Calgary for nearly two months, you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d know better&#8230;<br />
I was about a half hour late because what I thought was on the map ended up being something complete different, sending me off in a bad direction because I hadn&#8217;t expected the city planners to do something so stupid &#8230; or at least the map designers to mark it properly. Luckily, Greg wasn&#8217;t upset&#8230;<br />
Returning with Greg to downtown, we stopped at the Barley Mill, a bar at Eau Claire Market. It&#8217;s got probably the best selection of draught beer in town, and is cheaper than Shank&#8217;s. Greg and I perched ourselves on the patio, and basked in the warm sunshine.<br />
It was good to see Greg again. I hadn&#8217;t seen him since he helped bring me to Calgary. I know this will sound weird, but seeing Greg was kind of like pinching myself, helping me to remember that the last two years weren&#8217;t a dream. Call it a reality check if you want. But it was good to see him.<br />
We talked for a couple of hours about virtually everything that we could think of. Greg had to be careful, though. I&#8217;m not a Radical employee, and he had to skirt the cool stuff that&#8217;s always floating around there. I could tell he was having a bit of trouble too &#8212; he almost looked like a kid who&#8217;s just dying to tell some other kid a secret. I found one of them out this morning on the &#8216;Net &#8212; Radical&#8217;s not making sports games anymore. At least not for Fox, who announced they were bailing out of the genre. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what Radical does next&#8230;<br />
My phone rang around 3:30. It was Aunt Brenda. Easter Dinner Part 2 was with the rest of the Western Clan (save for Nana) that evening, and I was informed that I would be picked up at 5:00 instead of 6:00. This meant Greg and I had to cut our visit a bit short. Luckily though, the time didn&#8217;t seem too short.<br />
As we left the Barley Mill, Greg asked if it was possible to go by the Alberta Boot Factory Outlet. I had mentioned earlier in one of our conversations that I not only work but live fairly close to it (relax, I&#8217;m not buying cowboy boots), and Greg was looking to see what he could find.<br />
The Alberta Boot Factory Outlet is on 10th Ave. SW, at the corner of 5th St. (just a block or so away from Cowboys &#8212; a local western bar). It&#8217;s large &#8212; so is the selection. But Greg&#8217;s criteria were tight &#8230; very tight. There was one pair in the entire shop that he liked. Really liked. I mean *really* liked.<br />
But he didn&#8217;t buy &#8217;em. Though if he had the money, he would have. Why didn&#8217;t he? One of his criteria was for steel toes, and I have yet to hear of a cowboy boot with steel toes. (I certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to go line dancing with someone who wore steel-toed cowboy boots &#8230; not that I&#8217;d want to line dancing in the first place.)<br />
Greg agonized about the boot problem all the way back to his Aunt&#8217;s. I know what that kind of torture feels like. I&#8217;m on a restricted budget myself. I get paid this week (I think &#8212; the schedule here is a little strange), at which point I can start getting my life in gear.<br />
I met my Aunt and Uncle out in front of my apartment building at 5:15 (I&#8217;d called earlier and asked for a short delay). Then it was off to a part of the family I&#8217;d never met before. This was my Aunt Alaine&#8217;s sister and brother in-law. They own a home in the western edge of Kensington. A nice home. A really nice home.<br />
My parents had met Dawn and Ron before, when they went on a cruise about a year ago. This was good for me &#8212; it meant I wasn&#8217;t a complete stranger to them. We got there before the rest of the family, so we took the opportunity to look around a bit.<br />
The house is amazing. It&#8217;s on a small lot, so it&#8217;s a very vertical house. If only the home builders in Vancouver knew how nice a place you could build on such a small lot&#8230; The main floor had the dining space, living space, kitchen, and a parlour. Only the parlour had doors, the rest of it was open space.<br />
The kitchen was finished with cherry cabinets (wood, not colour). Ron mentioned that he&#8217;d never use cherry again &#8212; too high maintenance. Uncle Mike and I marvelled at the construction &#8212; it was gorgeous. As was the rest of the house. The upstairs had possibly the most efficient use of space I&#8217;d ever seen. Three bedrooms, all quite large. Certainly a liveable space.<br />
The Tisdales arrived not long after us. It&#8217;d been almost a year since I last saw Uncle David and Aunt Alaine, about a month since I&#8217;d seen Pam (and Muck, her boyfriend &#8230; don&#8217;t ask about the name, it&#8217;s not his real one, and I honestly don&#8217;t know the story behind it), and a couple of months since I&#8217;d seen Darren. (I last ran into him out front of the Capitol 6 when Pure3D had gone to see Toy Story 2.)<br />
Darren was a bit of a surprise. We were under the impression that he was in Indonesia doing some field work. We didn&#8217;t actually know he wasn&#8217;t there, and was in Calgary, until the night before when Uncle Mike was making golf arrangements with Uncle David. Apparently, Darren&#8217;s company didn&#8217;t get the permits they needed for the team &#8230; Darren hopes he&#8217;ll be going sometime in early May.<br />
Our final arrival was Dawn and Ron&#8217;s daughter. Now I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb here and say her name was &#8220;Randy&#8221;. It might be &#8220;Randyne&#8221;, or &#8220;Rian&#8221; or &#8220;Ryean&#8221; &#8230; all I know is that I heard &#8220;Randy&#8221; when someone said her name. For all I know, it&#8217;s not her real name. For some stupid reason, I never asked. (I&#8217;m certain someone will correct me on this.)<br />
We stood about, chatting and snacking, until about 7:15, at which time we piled into three cars, and drove to our restaurant for the evening. This was Pam&#8217;s idea, and I&#8217;m going to give her full credit for sticking her neck out on this, and finding one gem of a good restaurant.<br />
It&#8217;s called &#8220;Kremlin&#8221;, and like the name suggests, it serves Soviet cuisine. I&#8217;d say &#8220;Russian&#8221;, but that wouldn&#8217;t be correct. Several of the items on the menu are Ukrainian (such as the pirogies), of which Uncle David took extreme pleasure in ribbing Uncle Mike (whose heritage is Ukrainian). My family&#8217;s a little weird some times. (Have I mentioned the midnight excursion through a golf course on mountain bikes looking for elk?)<br />
We all opted to get platters of food, so we could all share in the various tastes of the menu. The server/owner told us that because they had only four burners, they&#8217;d have to bring food out in shifts.<br />
Oh yeah, I never told you how big this place was. Ever seen pictures of those small, quaint little Dari-Freeze joints? 50&#8217;s-style? That was what housed Kremlin. Tiny doesn&#8217;t even really come close to describing the size of this place. There were six tables. We had two of them. We dominated the place, literally. We outnumbered all the other patrons combined, and we certainly were louder than them.<br />
The first round was pirogies. There were two flavours: Spinach and feta cheese, and pork and ginger. I much preferred the spinach and cheese &#8212; I found the pork a little bit on the mushy side. But they were very tasty, as was the coleslaw (or Ukrainian salad, I&#8217;m not exactly sure what it was) and the roasted nuts. I stayed away from the beets. Ick.<br />
Round two was tequila prawns. (Doesn&#8217;t sound Soviet to me, but hey &#8212; it&#8217;s worth trying.) Yes, I eat prawns. Go figure. They were accompanied with some rice which added some excellent flavour.<br />
We had to wait a while for round three, during which time we delved into a couple more bottles of wine (I cut myself off at about two glasses, opting for a bottle of Alexander Keith&#8217;s instead).<br />
Round three was curried chicken and rice (supposedly basmati, but it sure tasted like couscous), appearing about a half hour or so later. This, again, was an excellent part of the meal, and was fairly filling. It was a good choice.<br />
Now, most people would end dinner there. But we were having too much fun, and dove into dessert. First off were fruit and chocolate crepes, followed shortly by banana and chocolate egg rolls (topped with ice cream). The last round was fruit pirogies. Oh yes, please understand that we didn&#8217;t get full orders each &#8212; these were platters as well.<br />
Then came the bill. A quick batch of math, and I dove into my wallet to dig out enough to pay for dinner. Imagine my horror when I realized I was $20 short. I was about to ask to be let out and raid a bank machine when Uncle David told me to put my wallet away (he did the same for Darren, Pam, and Muck). I said it before, and I&#8217;ll say it again &#8212; I love my family.<br />
Three and a half hours after entering, we all staggered out and found our ways home. I practically collapsed onto the mat on the floor until I could move again. Ouch.<br />
Sunday in downtown Calgary is quiet &#8212; nothing opens before noon. Which is fine with me &#8212; gives me time to sleep in and do other things. Like sleep.<br />
I went out walking around downtown, popping in and out of whatever stores happened to actually be open (a large number of them declared they were closed for Easter) before I ended up back at Critical Mass, again to do some work for a friend.<br />
I spent the rest of the day cleaning up. I made more headway on Sunday than I had in the past week. Probably because I had nothing better to do. I was waiting for Stuart and Therese to get back from Edmonton so we could get together. I was in no rush.<br />
At a little after 5:00, Stuart called. They hadn&#8217;t left Edmonton yet, and wouldn&#8217;t likely be leaving for a while. I suspected they were having worlds more fun than I was. Instead of dinner with friends, I went over to the Subway (barely a block away) and got something to get me through until morning.<br />
It was a good weekend, but I should think I would call it Thanksgiving Weekend, rather than Easter. I had a lot to be thankful for: My family, my friends, my freedom.<br />
Hmm&#8230; sounds like a good motto.</p>

		<p>If it were possible to work like a dog, my name would be Rover.<br />
Bow wow.<br />
I&#8217;m working on the latest and greatest version of a website we&#8217;re doing for one of our Fortune 500 clients. There are nine people on the team: Three designers, two project managers, a production person, one and a half programmers, and one web developer &#8212; that is, me. Our project was due tomorrow. Despite the approximate 200 hours I&#8217;ve put in during the past two weeks (no, I&#8217;m not kidding), that&#8217;s just not happening. There&#8217;s still so much to do.<br />
So yes, I&#8217;ve been busy. For quite a while. Been working my tail off. (Yeah, there&#8217;s that dog reference you&#8217;ve been waiting for me to spring on you.)<br />
I&#8217;ve pulled a few near-all nighters. I usually end up pulling &#8217;em with Dave, one of my colleagues, and the guy who hired me. We get really goofy around 2am or so. Usually we&#8217;re loaded up on Coke or Pepsi and adrenaline (from playing Unreal Tournament). You&#8217;d be amazed how much I can actually get done when it&#8217;s just Dave and I plugging away at our seemingly endless list of problems.<br />
So Friday rolls around. I&#8217;m planning on being here during the weekend, to finish more work. (I&#8217;ve got lots of it &#8212; enough to last at least another week.) Nancy (my project manager) calls me to discuss a few things. I let her know I&#8217;ll tackle them during the weekend. The conversation goes like this:<br />
Me: Yeah, I&#8217;ll fix it over the weekend.<br />
Nancy: No, you won&#8217;t. Look, Geoff, take the weekend off.<br />
Me: Can&#8217;t, too much work to be done by Tuesday. [Tuesday&#8217;s our deadline.]<br />
Nancy: Geoff, go home for the weekend. Don&#8217;t make me make you&#8230;<br />
She called back at about 5:30 that evening. Dave and I were engaged in a serious game of blowing each other up with high explosives. The phone call went like this:<br />
Nancy: (Sternly) You&#8217;re still here.<br />
Me: Uh, yeah? I usually am&#8230; (oooh, you little weasel, I&#8217;ll get you for that!!)<br />
Nancy: Go home, Geoff. Now.<br />
Me: I&#8217;m not doing work!! Honest! (HA! Take that, Dave!!)<br />
Nancy: Then what are you doing?<br />
Me: Playing video games with Dave. (You missed!! You missed!! CRAP! You didn&#8217;t miss!)<br />
Nancy: Oh, well, that&#8217;s fine. Just don&#8217;t do anything productive, okay?<br />
I got a cool project manager.<br />
Not working this weekend wasn&#8217;t easy. I had the urge to come back and fix things. Yes, I&#8217;m dedicated to the project. I want to see it work well. Call me weird&#8230;<br />
So Friday night, Chris and I met a friend (and co-worker), Sylvie, at Eau Claire Theatres to catch the Friday premiere of the most anticipated movie of the month. No, not &#8220;The Cell&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;Godzilla 2000&#8221;, of course! There&#8217;s nothing like watching some guy in a massive rubber suit trash models of Tokyo. Especially when it&#8217;s presented on the big screen! (We saw &#8220;The Cell&#8221; the following night with Dave.)<br />
It was a weird night. As we left the theatre, I suggested to Chris that we pop into Pongo, a trendy little neo-Asian restaurant on 17th Ave. As we walked down 4th St. towards Pongo, we encountered two young ladies who were (assumedly) on their way to the Palace. They required some assistance.<br />
The first question, which I missed, was &#8220;Hey, do you guys have sisters??&#8221;<br />
Chris answered the question correctly. The answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;. They assumed (rather poorly, at least in my case) that our sisters would have asked our opinions as to their appearance before going out clubbing. Cathy has never asked me such a question (she&#8217;s smart enough to know I&#8217;m utterly clueless about most of these things). These two poor girls, however, were too drunk to notice that I&#8217;m clueless.<br />
Okay, maybe not the blonde. She knew enough to ask only Chris.<br />
Anyway, they literally wanted us to check them out. They invited us. Only in Calgary, I tell you &#8230; only in Calgary. I&#8217;ve never in my life been invited to purposely ogle, and then offer words of encouragement. It threw both Chris and I for a bit of a loop.<br />
Our interrogators walked onto their destination (after momentarily chastising us for not going with them &#8212; I believe their exact words were &#8220;You&#8217;re going the wrong way!!&#8221;), and we headed towards ours. But the weirdness didn&#8217;t end there&#8230;<br />
As we arrived at Pongo, three jock-types leaned over and asked if we would flip two women &#8220;the bird&#8221; as we walked in. We were told that &#8220;we know those chicks&#8221;, and that it would be in good fun. Chris and I don&#8217;t play those games, especially if we&#8217;re single, they&#8217;re single, and there&#8217;s a hope in hell of *something* happening. (Hey, we might be silly, but we ain&#8217;t stupid &#8230; most of the time, anyway.)<br />
We were running out of excuses not to when one of the women piped up: &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve got a beer glass, and I ain&#8217;t afraid to use it!&#8221; Chris ended our conversation with the jocks: &#8220;No offence guys, but she frightens me more than you do.&#8221;<br />
On Saturday, Chris and I wandered about Calgary, wandering mostly aimlessly. It was great. I hadn&#8217;t been out of the office for so long, I&#8217;d forgotten the sun was even out. We walked in and out of malls and shops, not looking for anything in particular (though I did buy another CD recommended by my &#8220;source&#8221; at A&amp;B Sound). While we were there, we ran into our newest friend in Calgary, Shannon. She&#8217;s a long-term A&amp;B employee looking to get out.<br />
Chris and I have become career counsellors for Shannon. She&#8217;s been offered the chance to get a job at the Calgary Sun. But she&#8217;s been out of the loop for so long, she&#8217;s not sure how to get the job. So Chris and I are working to improve her portfolio and resume. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll be able to do something for her.<br />
Only in Calgary would someone you really only got to know that day call you up for help in getting a better job. Only in Calgary&#8230;<br />
Anyway, I&#8217;m late at the office again, having taken a chainsaw to some really nasty software bugs in the code. I had a few minutes to whip of a &#8220;hello, I&#8217;m alive&#8221; message. I hope y&#8217;all are doing well, and hopefully we&#8217;ll talk in the not-too-distant future&#8230;</p>

I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of it lately. I&#8217;ve moved three times in the past four months. Makes the moves I did in co-op seem trivial (I moved only every four months). But this time I&#8217;m not going anywhere for a while.<br />
For some strange reason, the apartment management wanted to finish a few things around the apartment. Although a &#8220;new&#8221; carpet went in (although it feels good, I can&#8217;t really tell if it&#8217;s new or not), they wanted to shampoo the carpets. I don&#8217;t quite understand that one, but who am I to argue something like that? Especially when I didn&#8217;t that close a look at the carpet in the first place&#8230;<br />
On Saturday, I got up to a phone call. It took a moment for me to realise that it was my phone ringing. It was my parents. They&#8217;ve been looking at a new motorhome. Their existing one is a RoadTrek 190 Versatile. It&#8217;s essentially a converted (and slightly extended) cargo van. Very comfortable inside, and nice. But not for my parents anymore. They wanted something a little larger &#8212; a Class A RV.<br />
Class A RVs are purpose-built vehicles. They are effectively homes on wheels. Very comfortable, and the ultimate things for travelling everywhere. I&#8217;d been sticking my nose into the dealerships around Calgary for them (there are quite a few here), getting details and offering my opinions.<br />
They had recently been looking at 29&#8242; Landau model built by a company called Georgie Boy (http://www.georgieboy.com). I&#8217;d never heard of them before, but based on the number of dealerships they have in Canada, I can understand why. Mom had sent Aunt Brenda a blurb about how they were looking at a used one that looked not all that great. I had concerns.<br />
This is what the phone call was about. Dad was concerned that I was concerned. I voiced them as well as I could, using one of Dad&#8217;s phrases: &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to do it, do it right the first time.&#8221; I was worried that they might settle for something they didn&#8217;t quite want. I wasn&#8217;t too keen on learning that the (rather expensive) motorhome they bought wasn&#8217;t what they wanted. So I dug up a local dealer (I love the Internet!), threw some clothes on, and went to take a look at one.<br />
I had a quick (literally) stop at Registry Unlimited, where I picked up my brand-new Alberta license plate. I am now officially an Alberta resident. My hate of ICBC increased again when I found out I have to mail my old BC plates back &#8212; at least Ontario has the wherewithal to have the out-of-province registries accept the plates and send them back.<br />
Whipping out my map, I looked to see if I could find South Highway Drive SE. It wasn&#8217;t on any of my maps. But there was a place in the South East quadrant of the city labelled &#8220;Blackfoot Trailer Park&#8221;. It seemed like a decent candidate for having an RV dealership nearby.<br />
As I departed the Registry&#8217;s parking lot, my phone rang &#8212; it was Stuart. He was out test driving cars (I think this is one of Stuart&#8217;s most favourite things to do). But he was nearly done, and wanted to get together (assumedly for some moderate mayhem). I asked if he was up to helping me move. Albeit a bit reluctant (who isn&#8217;t?), he agreed to come by and help out. But first I needed to find a Georgie Boy.<br />
I never did. The trailer park was a trailer park, and nothing else. Upon returning home, I found that the dealership is not far from Medicine Hat, quite a ways from Calgary. A little too far for my limited time that day.<br />
Uncle Mike and I started loading up his truck with the smaller things in my collection of junk. This included boxes of books, speakers, a large sack full of CDs (I suspect the cases are mostly broken at this point, though not due to any mishandling on our part), bags of clothes &#8230; basically anything I didn&#8217;t have to worry about. But there were certain things that the truck would not hold. Like my TV&#8230;<br />
For those of you who don&#8217;t know, I have a home theatre. I acquired this when I was living at home a couple years ago. The centrepiece is a 50&#8243; rear-projection TV. It&#8217;s big. Not horribly heavy, but big. And you can&#8217;t lay it down flat (that would be bad, very bad). This necessitates a second moving vehicle, one with some vertical clearance in it.<br />
Originally, I was going to move on Saturday, except that the building told me they were going to shampoo the carpet again. This meant the carpet would be wet. Not exactly ideal for moving stuff around. As such, we didn&#8217;t do anything but load my uncle&#8217;s truck.<br />
Stuart arrived just as we finished. Not having anything else to do (moving-wise), the two of us opted for going out and doing &#8230; stuff. The first stop was at Revy. During my previous move, one of the casters on my stereo cabinet shattered, and needed to be replaced. Luckily, this wasn&#8217;t a big deal. My dad built the cabinet, so the casters were standard hardware. The ones I found were almost identical, save for the mounting plate, which was brass instead of silver.<br />
Then we headed off for IKEA. I needed a bed and/or a couch (I gotta sleep on something) and wanted to see what IKEA had. First we ducked into the Chrysler dealership to view the new PT Cruiser. It&#8217;s a beautiful little thing &#8212; the only reason Stuart would every buy a minivan-like vehicle. Very stylish. We followed up with a quick stop at a nearby Volkswagen dealer (Stuart&#8217;s mildly obsessed with finding a silver Jetta, though with good reason) before finally ended up at IKEA.<br />
The IKEA in Burlington (Ontario) is usually a zoo on Sunday. The IKEA in Richmond (British Columbia) is usually a nightmare on a Sunday. Stuart and I breezed through Calgary&#8217;s. Wasn&#8217;t even an issue. I love this city &#8212; people are civil here.<br />
I found a couch, but I didn&#8217;t get one. It dawned on me kind of all-of-the-sudden like that I shouldn&#8217;t even be considering these things without discussing them with Chris, my soon-to-be-roommate. So no major furniture until then. I found a couple beds, too &#8212; but there were a bit pricey for what I wanted.<br />
Leaving IKEA, we drove more-or-less aimlessly until we ended up downtown. I directed Stuart to my new apartment. I wanted him to see what it looked like. The carpet was bone dry. It looked like they hadn&#8217;t even been there yet. I was a little annoyed.<br />
The aimless driving took us most of the way down in the South West without actually finding anything interesting. Except for Tom Jones&#8217; new album. He covers &#8220;Little Green Bag&#8221;. Actually, the whole album is cover tunes. Great stuff.<br />
Remembering that there was an outlet mall in the North, I asked Stuart if we could scoot up there to take a look. The mall was without content &#8212; we stayed only long enough to get the heck outta there. Outlet malls are not nice places.<br />
Then we started The Mission. Stuart had been wanting to find something in the North of Calgary for some time, but hadn&#8217;t really had the opportunity before. Today, he did. And we were off, in search of The Most Fabulous Object In the World &#8230; or at least Calgary. We drove back and forth, in search of an address we could not find. Eventually, we hit the proverbial jackpot &#8212; we learned that the address was in the Beddington Village Mall.<br />
It&#8217;s a non-descript mall, though it looks significantly better than its neighbour across the road. It&#8217;s got a Safeway, a London Drugs, a few other neat little shops &#8230; one special place that Stuart and I have been pining for for the last 15 years.<br />
Mother&#8217;s Pizza.<br />
Hmm&#8230; it just dawned on me that some of you have probably never heard of Mother&#8217;s. This was, bar none, the best pizza on Earth. It was a chain that was quite popular (at least in Ontario) until about 15 years ago, when they went out of business. Stuart tells me it was because they mismanaged their funds. Little Caesar&#8217;s went around buying up Mother&#8217;s locations, eventually wiping them all out. It was a sad day when their restaurant in Oakville closed. Stuart and I have fond memories (indivudally &#8212; we didn&#8217;t know each other back then) of going there for birthdays and watching black and white movies of The Three Stooges, Little Rascals, Abbott and Costello, and Laurel and Hardy.<br />
Now this isn&#8217;t some place called Mother&#8217;s, this *is* Mother&#8217;s. Probably the last of its kind. It&#8217;s been 15 years since I last had Mother&#8217;s, yet I can remember the taste as if it were yesterday. We felt like Indiana Jones, unearthing the Ark of the Covenant in the Well of Souls &#8230; at least without the snakes. And the Nazis. And the sand. You get the idea&#8230;<br />
We were a little apprehensive at first. Was this in fact Mother&#8217;s? Would it taste the same, or were we headed for supreme disappointment? There was only one way to find out. We ordered a couple of slices.<br />
The anticipation was murder. Everything looked right. It was the same logo. The same boxes. The same smell &#8230; well, almost. The lobby of the Mother&#8217;s restaurant in Oakville reeked of mushrooms.<br />
The pizza arrived. It looked like Mother&#8217;s. Hopes were high. We sat down, Stuart immediately diving into his, only to be repulsed at the high temperature. My slices were moderately cooler, so I bit into mine.<br />
It was Mother&#8217;s Pizza. After 15 years, we could taste it again. It wasn&#8217;t exact, but it was pretty darn close. The major difference was that my pepperoni was underneath the cheese rather than on top of it. When I order from them again, I&#8217;ll make sure to correct that little oversight.<br />
Fully happy with our conquest, we returned to my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s, where Stuart dropped me off. He had plans for the evening, and I didn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
The next day was moving day. I got up earlier and headed out to Brentwood Village in the Northwest. A new store called Linen and Things was opening, and I wanted to see if there were any deals. I should have known better than that&#8230; I did find one thing that looked promising &#8212; a two-tier vegetable and rice steamer for $50 (with a coupon, regularly $60). I called Aunt Brenda first to see if she thought that was a decent price, given the one that she uses. She recommended I check out Costco.<br />
Returning to my relative&#8217;s home, they gave me a little slip of paper. Costco members can &#8220;sponsor&#8221; a new member by giving them this little piece of paper. That, plus $45, gets you access to a warehouse full of stuff that you&#8217;ll probably never need. But they had the same rice steamer as Linen and Things &#8230; for $40. Already this membership was paying off.<br />
Then it was off to get a van. I had zipped into Budget earlier in the morning and reserved a panel van to help me move. I figured it was big enough to hold the TV (that was my primary concern), based on a rough measurement. I thought it would be a quick pick-up, and I&#8217;d be off.<br />
I should really know better by now&#8230;<br />
They brought out a one-ton truck. I thought something was amiss when the clerk asked me if I new how to drive a delay-start diesel. (Most vans aren&#8217;t diesel.) I asked them to bring out the van I asked for. That was my mistake. I should&#8217;ve just taken the truck. It took them nearly 20 minutes to bring me the van.<br />
By the time I got back to my relatives&#8217; home, Stuart was there waiting. I didn&#8217;t have time to pack the remainder of my stuff in the basement, and opted for a quick haul of the main bulky stuff. Uncle Mike had a basketball game at 4:00, and I didn&#8217;t want him to miss it.<br />
Sidetrack time &#8230; sorry, but there&#8217;s something here I need to say.<br />
Two months ago, I felt very alone. I had a lot of friends at Radical Entertainment, but aside from them, I was alone. I went out to Calgary to visit with Stuart and Therese, at which time I decided I was going to leave Vancouver. But in order to leave, I needed a place to go. I intended to ask my Aunt and Uncle if I could stay for a couple of days, during which time I&#8217;d find some place to stay.<br />
I didn&#8217;t even get the chance to ask &#8212; they offered. Three weeks later, I arrived with a truck (partially) full of junk. Without even a pause, they moved the contents into one of their (spare) rooms. For the next month and a half, they gave me a roof over my head and food on my plate.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t alone. If only for that reason, they (and my cousin Jen) helped me through one of the saddest and depressing points of my life. Through their selflessness, their caring, and their help, I am able to stand out on my own again, and be the person I need to be. For this, I will be eternally grateful for all they&#8217;ve done. I hope that I can at some point be able to pay them back for all they&#8217;ve done &#8230; certainly at least for all the beer they gave me.<br />
All my family has stood behind me. My sister Cathy was right there from the start of all this &#8212; were it not for her, I might not have been able to get the gumption to do what I did. I told her early on because I knew that if I wavered, she&#8217;d fly out and haul my butt out of the province. If anything, the threat of her coming out there got me out.<br />
My parents were there all the way. There was no question of my actions &#8212; they understood. As did all my family. I know that a lot of you may argue with me on this, but I have the best family in the world. I wouldn&#8217;t trade them for anything.<br />
And for that matter &#8212; I have the best friends in the world. They&#8217;ve all been there for me. Not one negative word (at least not told to me), and many offers of assistance. From ex-roommates to former co-workers to my friends at Radical to my closest circle of friends. I thank all of your for all that you&#8217;ve done &#8212; even if it&#8217;s just a letter or a joke to cheer me up.<br />
Okay, enough of this sappy stuff&#8230;<br />
The TV was a problem. I measured wrong. (Figures&#8230;) We had to get creative to get the TV in the van. It fit once we got it inside, but the door was a little lower than the inside. In 15 minutes, we were packed and headed towards downtown.<br />
I had the elevator booked from 2:00 until 4:00. There was another unit moving in from 12:00 until 2:00. I hoped they would be done. They weren&#8217;t. A huge Allied moving van was still there, and wouldn&#8217;t leave until nearly 2:30. It was problematic.<br />
Moving in didn&#8217;t take too long, we managed to move in quite quickly, dumping virtually everything in the living room. It was where we had space. I&#8217;ll sort out the rest of that stuff later&#8230;<br />
Almost as soon as we were done, Uncle Mike shot back out to make his basketball game. Stuart and I still had the van, so getting back wasn&#8217;t a problem. It also let us stop and get something to eat for lunch (though it was nearly 3:30 by the time we got to eat). A stop at Harvey&#8217;s solved that little issue.<br />
We dropped the van off and returned Stuart to his car. He had things to do, and I had some more stuff to still pack. Aunt Brenda coerced me (like it takes a lot of effort) to stick around for dinner (my Last Supper, so to speak) before heading out to my new apartment. That gave me time to finish packing and put everything in the car. Then it was time for me to leave.<br />
I moved the last of my things into the apartment (albeit with a little difficulty &#8212; I had one box that was quite heavy). Then I got to stare at my new life. An apartment with a lot of junk and no furniture, save for the TV and the stereo cabinet. The first order of business was straightening a few things out. I put the foam mattress (loaned from my Aunt and Uncle) in my bedroom and unpacked my sleeping bag. Then I got down to the serious stuff, and washed a few dishes (also loaners).<br />
Then I plugged in the TV. I wanted to know how well it had survived the trip across the Rockies and across Calgary. Not only the TV work, but I had basic cable (the building manager seemed to indicate there was no cable). At least I could watch the X-Files&#8230;<br />
For the first time in almost two years, I was the only one in the apartment. I was on my own. Considering I slept on the floor, I slept pretty well&#8230;<br />
So I&#8217;m the process of getting settled, though I don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;ll take. I need to get a lot of things &#8212; something to put my clothes in, something to sleep on (other than the floor), at least one chair, and a light or two. Maybe then it&#8217;ll feel more like an apartment, rather than a collection of junk&#8230;<br />
Which reminds me &#8212; some of you might want to contact me now that I&#8217;m settled. Grab a pen and paper, &#8216;cuz you might want to know this:<br />
[This information is not available on the web &#8230; sorry.]<br />
I won&#8217;t move for a year and a half. I promise.<br />
I hope all of you are doing well. I hope to be writing/speaking to all of you soon!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It is said that the best things come to those who wait. I can safely say that I&#8217;ve got good things coming.<br />
It&#8217;s been a month since my somewhat dramatic departure from Vancouver and I entered into obscurity. It&#8217;s high time that you all found out what the heck happened since then. Some of you already know, but this is for everyone else&#8230;<br />
The destination was Calgary. Reason: I have family here (relatives &#8212; my parents and sister live in Ontario) and I have friends here. Calgary is also an ideal location for getting a job, particularly if you&#8217;re in the high-tech industry. I arrived here in late afternoon on March 1, and have been here ever since.<br />
The job hunt was important, and it began almost immediately. My first (and only) interview with a company was only two days after arriving. I continued to search through the Internet (Workopolis, Monster.Ca, and various other sites) and landed a few interviews with headhunters (ack!).<br />
Things picked up when Critical Mass (the company I interviewed with) called to check my references. Three weeks after arriving in Calgary, I landed a job. I am now a Web Developer at Critical Mass, developer to the stars &#8230; or at least American companies with a lot of money.<br />
I started on Monday. I would&#8217;ve sent this email then, but I didn&#8217;t have a computer. I didn&#8217;t get a computer until nearly noon yesterday, and then I got buried under a rush job. They don&#8217;t waste time around here trying to break newbies. It was daunting to say the least &#8212; I knew no-one, had no idea what I was doing, and was being thrown into a project I new nothing about.<br />
It was great. Really. I enjoyed it.<br />
Except for the fact that I worked until 23:15 last night. On my second day. At least my name is getting around&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m realizing that my web development skills are going to accelerate about 100 fold in the next few days as I learn all these neat tricks Critical Mass has developed over the past year or two.<br />
CM parallels Radical in many ways &#8212; lots of people (estimates are around 160), they occupy most of a building except for a quasi-architectural firm on the first floor, the average age is in the mid-to-late 20&#8217;s, and the talent here is amazing. I hope I can live up to the competition.<br />
But it&#8217;s definitely not Radical. Maybe in time I&#8217;ll think of them as being the same, but for now &#8230; well, it&#8217;s a living.<br />
I have a new apartment in downtown Calgary. It&#8217;s nice, and has a view of the north and of downtown. It&#8217;s really close to a lot of things, including work (a five minute commute on foot) &#8230; my roommate (and one of my best friends) Chris joins me in a few weeks.<br />
Hmm&#8230;<br />
You&#8217;d think that after a month, I&#8217;d have a lot to write about. I guess not. My log entries will hopefully be a tad more frequent. Oh, and as I do with each new email address I have &#8212; any of you who would prefer not to receive these (relax, they only come every couple of weeks or so), please let me know.</p>

		<p>[Ed. Note: This is the actual message I sent to most everyone I knew, letting them know what had just happened.]<br />
Today, I completed two of the most traumatic experiences of my life. One was leaving Radical Entertainment, and saying goodbye to the friends that I made. The second was leaving Allison, thus ending a period of extreme hardship. I&#8217;ve set out to find myself.<br />
Yes, this sounds quite dumb &#8212; isn&#8217;t the whole &#8220;finding one&#8217;s self&#8221; a tired topic by this day and age? Normally, I&#8217;d say yes. But in this case, I beg to differ. I lost myself two years ago in a relationship I&#8217;ve never really been happy with. I need to rediscover who I&#8217;m meant to be.<br />
For roughly two years, I&#8217;ve been in an abusive relationship. This is something that has taken me over two months to understand. I&#8217;ve been through a lot of pain and mental anguish. Though Allison never laid a finger on me in anger (save for one incident, where she was in severe pain from illness, and lashed out at the nearest person &#8212; me), she was a surgeon with her words. They cut deep and never let me heal. More times than I can remember, she took me down, took me apart, and laid me in utter ruins.<br />
Having been through this so many times, it got to the point where it was normal, and I believed I was happy. This is what psychology refers to as the &#8220;cycle of abuse&#8221;. It&#8217;s one of the most misunderstood issues in psychology, and one of the hardest to treat. Generally, the victim only gets better when they realize that there&#8217;s something wrong, and they&#8217;re not willing to take it any more. Typically, the victim will leave their abuser.<br />
It&#8217;s not a simple case for me, however. Outside of my friends from work, I know no-one else in the Lower Mainland. All of my friends are Allison&#8217;s, and as soon as I left her, they probably turned against me. By the end of today, my name is most likely mud in the Lower Mainland.<br />
That is why I&#8217;ve left Vancouver forever.<br />
This was something that I started a few weeks ago, when I started to come out of the haze that I&#8217;d been living for two years. I realized what was happening to me, and that I had to get out.<br />
I enlisted help. You can&#8217;t do things like this without it. I brought certain people into this whom I could trust implicitly. I kept all my plans almost entirely secret &#8212; anyone told of the plan was also sworn to secrecy. I wanted to tell all of you, but if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned over the years, it&#8217;s that Six Degrees of Separation is a real thing &#8212; and I couldn&#8217;t let Allison know I was leaving.<br />
No, she didn&#8217;t know. I couldn&#8217;t let her know. Had Allison found out, I doubt I would be where I am now. I would probably be still in Vancouver, languishing in the limelight of abuse. This was a future I did not want.<br />
I first asked Stuart, one of my best friends. It wasn&#8217;t even an issue &#8212; Stuart was ready. I then asked Greg, one of my co-workers, and probably one of my closest friends in the Lower Mainland. I asked him only to help me pack the truck with my things. He went one further and offered to help drive.<br />
This was a good thing &#8212; Stuart had to pull out a few days later after his company hit him with a huge project and a tight deadline. I got Joel, another co-worker and friend, to help me pack.<br />
Tuesday was one of the longest days of my life. The last 10 minutes at Radical were the hardest. I didn&#8217;t want to leave. I wanted to continue working there. But I had to say goodbye to my co-workers &#8230; to my friends. I nearly broke down crying several times. But the one that still brings tears to my eye was when I said goodbye to Neall.<br />
Neall maintains &#8220;The List&#8221;. It&#8217;s a list of all the veteran Radical employees (circa November 1998), sorted by start date. Whenever someone leaves (or even when the rumour of them leaving starts), he strikes them from The List. The List keeps track of where certain people sit in seniority.<br />
When I said my farewells to Neall, he informed me that he had not taken my name off The List. When asked why, he told me it was that he respected me too much to remove it. It took everything I had not to break down in tears. Never before have I ever felt so accepted in my life.<br />
Greg and Joel helped me pack the truck &#8212; they took the boxes and bags down while I filled more boxes and bags. By 8:15, we were ready to leave. I left Allison a note (she was at French class), left my keys, and we hit the road.<br />
We dropped Joel off at his home before Greg and I continued. I learned more about Joel in the trip from my apartment to his home than I ever thought possible. It made it all the harder to say goodbye. I found myself asking how much heartbreak I could subject myself to in one night.<br />
Greg and I continued to Merritt, through dense fog, rain, drizzle, and blinding snow. We stayed the night, and continued this morning. We arrived here late this afternoon, at which time I took Greg to see a friend.<br />
I dropped Greg off there. I didn&#8217;t want to leave &#8212; Greg was my last tie to Radical, to my friends. But I had to leave. I had to say goodbye to him. Never before has someone done something so selfless for me. His and Joel&#8217;s help I will never forget. As I will never forget my friends in Vancouver.<br />
Where I&#8217;m going is up for debate. Some of you know where I&#8217;m going, and for now that is the way it will remain. I&#8217;ll open up a little more in the not-too-distant future, but for now I&#8217;m keeping low and staying quiet. It&#8217;s nothing personal, folks, I just want to be alone for a while. I need time to recover and try to rebuild a life. But I will keep in touch &#8212; I promise.<br />
Take care, and I&#8217;ll be talking to you soon.<br />
&#8220;One day I&#8217;ll be a beautiful butterfly!&#8221;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>[Ed. Note: This message was never originally sent out. It first appeared on the web six months after it was written.]<br />
By the time you read this, I will already have done the most horrible thing I&#8217;ve ever done in my life. Without warning, I&#8217;ve left Allison to go find myself.<br />
Yes, this sounds quite dumb &#8212; isn&#8217;t the whole &#8220;finding one&#8217;s self&#8221; a tired topic by this day and age? Normally, I&#8217;d say yes. But in this case, I beg to differ. I lost myself two years ago in a relationship I&#8217;ve never really been happy with. I need to rediscover who I&#8217;m meant to be.<br />
For roughly two years, I&#8217;ve been in an abusive relationship. This is something that has taken me over two months to understand. I&#8217;ve been through a lot of pain and mental anguish. Though Allison never laid a finger on me in anger (save for one incident, where she was in severe pain from illness, and lashed out at the nearest person &#8212; me), she was a surgeon with her words. They cut deep and never let me heal. More times than I can remember, she took me down, took me apart, and laid me in utter ruins.<br />
Having been through this so many times, it got to the point where it was normal, and I believed I was happy. This is what psychology refers to as the &#8220;cycle of abuse&#8221;. It&#8217;s one of the most misunderstood issues in psychology, and one of the hardest to treat. Generally, the victim only gets better when they realize that there&#8217;s something wrong, and they&#8217;re not willing to take it any more. Typically, the victim will leave their abuser.<br />
It&#8217;s not a simple case for me, however. Outside of my friends from work, I know no-one else in the Lower Mainland. All of my friends are Allison&#8217;s, and as soon as I leave her, they will turn against me. That much is certain. Within hours, my name will be mud in the Lower Mainland.<br />
That is why I&#8217;m leaving Vancouver.<br />
Where I&#8217;m going is up for debate. Some of you know where I&#8217;m going, and for now that is the way it will remain. I&#8217;ll open up a little more in the not-too-distant future, but for now I&#8217;m keeping low and staying quiet. It&#8217;s nothing personal, folks, I just want to be alone for a while.<br />
This is mostly a heads-up. Don&#8217;t try to call me in Vancouver &#8212; I&#8217;m not there. Don&#8217;t try to call me at Radical &#8212; I quit. Don&#8217;t try to find me &#8212; you won&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t worry, though &#8212; I&#8217;ll be in good hands.<br />
Take care, and I&#8217;ll be talking to you soon.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We&#8217;ve been blessed with a good winter this year &#8212; it hasn&#8217;t rained much. (Of course, I would be writing this on a rainy day.) In fact, we&#8217;ve had a lot of sun, though it has been fairly chilly. Yes, I realize that chilly here is warm compared to the rest of Canada right now. What can I say &#8212; I&#8217;m a wimp.<br />
But even with all that good weather, Vancouver can get a little boring, especially if you don&#8217;t get out a lot. This was our problem &#8212; we hadn&#8217;t really gone anywhere except for the island in the past three months. So Allison and I decided it was time to visit Seattle again. A good road trip was just what we needed.<br />
We got up relatively early on Saturday (which for me, is before 9:00am) and got ready to leave. By 9:09, we were fuelled up and heading south on Burrard for our adventure of the day. We arrived at the border in short time, and breezed through, as usual. It was a good thing we weren&#8217;t coming from Seattle to Vancouver, though &#8212; the lineup looked about an hour in length.<br />
It was a good day for the drive &#8212; the sun was bright and the sky was (mostly) clear. We could see Mt. Baker quite easily. It&#8217;s a very imposing mountain, especially when you know that it&#8217;s two hours away, and the ones just across the Burrard Inlet look the same height. It&#8217;s huge &#8230; just like its sister mountain, Mt. Rainier. Both are dormant volcanos &#8230; just like Mount St. Helen&#8217;s was dormant.<br />
We found ourselves in downtown Seattle just after 12:00, just in time for lunch. We drove around attempting to find inexpensive parking (by inexpensive, we were looking for anything that charged less than US$7 an hour. Seattle is expensive.<br />
We eventually ended up at the lot Allison and her friend had once used when visiting Seattle. It has a US$5 special that lets you park for up to 10 hours. It&#8217;s not the most convenient location, but considering that there&#8217;s no lot attendant, no pavement, and nothing really nearby, it&#8217;s fairly reasonable.<br />
Actually, there is one thing nearby &#8212; an elevator. It takes you up to what used to be a causeway from &#8220;upper&#8221; Seattle to the piers on the waterfront. When the piers closed down, the causeway was mostly destroyed. Part of it remained, and the city (assumedly it was them) put in an elevator to let you down to the harbourfront. At the top, it let you out two blocks from Pike Place Market. Convenient, non?<br />
The first order of business was lunch. We had seen a mexican restaurant while searching for parking, but we were interested in a chili place at the south end of the market. It took a while to get there (about half the population of Washington State was crammed into the three blocks that make up the market area), and we were disappointed when we arrived. It seems that the owner/operator had been made an Honorary Member of the Coronary Bypass Association, and was enjoying an extended stay in the Swedish Hospital.<br />
Yeah, you&#8217;re probably thinking what we thought &#8212; he was in Sweden, the reason he wasn&#8217;t here to run the store, right? Well, it wasn&#8217;t until our little attempt to get lost in Seattle that we found the Swedish Hospital. It&#8217;s one of the hospitals in Seattle. Why &#8220;Swedish&#8221;? It was started in Seattle by a pair of Swedes back at the turn of the century. It&#8217;s now one of the largest hospitals in the state.<br />
Anyway, back to the story&#8230;<br />
Finding there would be no chili that day, we went out in search of our mysterious Mexican restaurant. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t hard &#8212; Taco Del Mar. It was a kind of fancy Taco Bell, without all the choices. But I was in the mood for a burrito, and that seemed to be their speciality. I got the jumbo spicy beef (which was their smallest burrito &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why they called it &#8220;jumbo&#8221;). Allison got the super burrito (the same as the jumbo, except it had guacamole).<br />
Kinda bland, not nearly as tasty as the burritos we had at some rinky-dinky little taco stand in Anaheim, but filling. At least we wouldn&#8217;t starve for the rest of the day. And the service was outstandingly pleasant for a fast-food joint. A definite thumbs up, if just for the service alone.<br />
Afterwards, we opted to try something we hadn&#8217;t done before &#8212; go to the Seattle Art Museum. Allison had been craving some intellectual input lately, and I thought a visit to the museum would be a good idea. The last time we were in Seattle, they were exhibiting Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s designs. This time, it was the History of Porcelain. Okay, maybe not the most riveting of subjects, but interesting nonetheless.<br />
The Chinese first started producing the fine porcelain we all know in the 10th Century CE (AD, for those of you not familiar with the Common Era system). However, they had developed the materials and techniques around 3200 BCE &#8230; a lot earlier than most people would have thought. In fact, the only thing that kept them from making good porcelain back then was a lack of heat. Porcelain needs temperatures of about 1,300 C to become porcelain &#8230; otherwise, you just get earthenware. Not as strong, and not as nice.<br />
There were some amazing specimens. Utterly beautiful in design, completely perfect in shape and colour. The designs on them intricate and delicate. Then you read the tag, and find that the bowl, or plate, or water jug you are looking at predates Chris Columbus&#8217; little sojourn to North America by a hundred years.<br />
The exhibit was arranged so that you walked in a loop, starting with the &#8220;birth&#8221; of porcelain, and ending with its &#8220;end&#8221;. (No, we haven&#8217;t disposed of porcelain, just that porcelain is now a pottery technique, not a commodity considered more valuable than precious metals.) The exhibit tells how until the 17th and 18th centuries, most of the porcelain came from China. But after a couple of wars, the technique finally leaked to Japan and Korea, and the supply increased. It wasn&#8217;t until the 17th century that Europe began to tinker with the techniques and come up with its own porcelain.<br />
After our tour of expensive pottery, we ventured to an exhibit of native art. A lot of it was Australian, and actually fairly difficult to look at (the pictures were a bit on the psychedelic side). We didn&#8217;t stay long, and opted for the more typical parts of an art museum: Ancient Mediterranean (e.g. Roman, Greek, Egyptian), the 17th century masters, 18th century art, 19th century Americana, and 20th century moderne, including photographs and a set of prints by Liechtenstein.<br />
We returned to the market, and walked through it again in the opposite direction. (This was when we learned the fate of the chili shop&#8217;s owner.) Like Vancouver&#8217;s Granville Island, the contents of Pike Place Market change fairly regularly, which makes finding some things fairly difficult. All depends on your needs, I guess. Anyway, we wandered around a bit before ending up at a small park overlooking the harbour. There, we sat on the grass, warmed ourselves in the sun, and watched the world walk by.<br />
After a while, we hit upon the idea of touring around Seattle. While Allison had been through other portions of the city before, I had only been in the downtown core. I wanted to see the rest of it. We returned to the car, and drove our way into the heart of the city &#8230; after I missed a turn and ended up in a different area. We were attempting to find Capitol Hill on our own. There were no signs, no hints, and we had no map. It makes for an interesting adventure.<br />
We drove around in seemingly endless loops (you have to understand that we weren&#8217;t really heading in any particular direction), eventually finding ourselves next to the convention centre. We headed east from there, soon finding ourselves at the Edward Nordstrom Medical Tower. This was when we found Seattle University and the Swedish Hospital. We headed south for a little ways until we opted to turn into one of the neighbourhoods &#8212; First Hill.<br />
First Hill is so named because it was one of Seattle&#8217;s first neighbourhoods. Thus, it is also one of the oldest &#8230; and it certainly looks that way. Most of the homes are run-down and/or boarded up. The neighbourhood is mostly poor. It&#8217;s sad, really, because with a little money, most of the homes would look much better.<br />
We soon found ourselves on 23rd Ave., turning north. We still didn&#8217;t know where Capitol Hill was, and it was time for us to find out. We popped into an AM/PM and picked up two Cokes and a map of Seattle. The map had all the information we wanted. Much to our surprise, we were not only in the right area, we weren&#8217;t far away from Capitol Hill. Another kilometre or so north on 23rd, and we were there.<br />
Capitol Hill looks like the kind of neighbourhood you see in Hollywood movies &#8212; nice, large homes on moderately-sized lots in a very nice area. Basically, a rich area. We drove up and down Capitol Hill&#8217;s streets, gaping at the homes, very much wishing that we could afford one.<br />
We soon left, on our second search of the day. Now, this quest definitely shows off our geekhood &#8212; we wanted to find Microsoft. I had a minor fascination with seeing what this company was actually like. One of the world&#8217;s most powerful companies, and all I&#8217;d ever actually seen was a small picture of one of its buildings (which, it turns out, is the recruiting building).<br />
We headed north on 23rd Ave. (which turns into 24th), and looked for off-ramp for Highway 520 East. We missed it, and ended up heading directly into the University of Washington. I was reminded very soon after of the long debates on USENET about who should own the uw.* hierarchy &#8212; the University of Washington, or the University of Waterloo. Several other UW schools tried to get into the debate, but we shut them out pretty quickly.<br />
The university is quite large, and has a nice campus. The buildings are old (or at least look old), much like the Ivy League schools back east. One of them is the Mary Gates building, named after Bill Gates&#8217; late mother, who was also a schoolteacher, UW regent, and a chair of United Way International. I guess Billy gets his goodwill from his mom.<br />
Finding our way to Highway 520, we headed for Redmond. We really had no exact idea where we were going, other than Redmond. We didn&#8217;t have directions, we didn&#8217;t know where in Redmond Microsoft lay, and our map didn&#8217;t show roads any smaller than the major highways.<br />
Arriving in Redmond about 30 minutes later, we proceeded to search. Redmond has two things: Industrial parks populated almost entirely by high-tech companies, and townhouses. There are a few actual houses, but the domicile of preference seems to be the higher-density models. It fits with the youngish population, I suppose.<br />
We drove around the city, covering the north, east, and west sides before finally stopping at a gas station for assistance. The clerk gave me a strange look, and with a straight face provided me directions. She probably added &#8220;geek&#8221; or &#8220;weirdo&#8221; as I left.<br />
Microsoft probably moved to Redmond because it needed space. A lot of space. A huge amount of space. The campus (and it really is a campus) is larger than most (if not all) Canadian universities. It&#8217;s not just huge, it&#8217;s freakin&#8217; huge. There are at least 50 buildings scattered about the area, covering every portion of the company. It&#8217;s impressive.<br />
The scary part is that there is no construction going on at Microsoft. All the buildings are complete. And full. This includes a conference centre, dormitories (large ones, about 20 storeys each), research labs, and separate offices for the Internet portions of the company. It&#8217;s frightening, just plain frightening. You actually have to wonder why the FTC hasn&#8217;t broken the company up yet.<br />
After our little tour, we returned to the highway, and headed our way home. The trip back was as uneventful as the trip down, and without the sun blinding our every movement. A couple of hours later, we arrived at the Cloverdale Truck crossing, and made our way back into Canada. Then we were off to find dinner.<br />
Originally, we were heading for the Langley crossing, which would have put us near the Sammy J. Peppers in Langley (or Surrey &#8230; one of the two). But we were a fair distance from it. So instead, we went to find the Sammy J. Peppers in Coquitlam. Along with the rest of the Lower Mainland.<br />
Luckily, we got there as the crowd was beginning to die down. We indulged ourselves in a nice meal, and prepared to retire to home with a good movie &#8212; Steve Martin&#8217;s &#8220;Bowfinger&#8221;.<br />
Sunday was our lazy day. We got up late, we didn&#8217;t move fast or far. Although we did for a long walk, eventually ending up at Urban Fare to get fixin&#8217;s for dinner. A fairly relaxing day.<br />
I&#8217;m glad we took the time to do all this &#8212; this week is going to be rough. I&#8217;ve got a small mountain of work that should probably kick into full gear by mid-afternoon today. Then I get to lock myself away until Friday, when the drafts are due. All supposed to be done by Tuesday. That&#8217;s my drop-dead date.<br />
I hate deadlines.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>[Ed. Note: This entry actually spans two weeks and is a composite of several private entries that were never mailed out. They first appeared on the web six months after they were written.]<br />
I feel like I&#8217;m in a nightmare, or at least a bad dream. The kind of dream where no matter how fast you can run, you can&#8217;t run fast enough. The kind where you&#8217;re not sure if you&#8217;re certain you&#8217;re not awake, but you can&#8217;t tell if you&#8217;re dreaming. It&#8217;s where the world is hazy and you&#8217;re a minute or two behind the world.<br />
I hate myself for what I&#8217;m going to do, and I haven&#8217;t even done it yet. I&#8217;m going to leave Allison. But I&#8217;m not letting her know. Not until after it&#8217;s done. I can&#8217;t bear the thought of having to tell her. I can&#8217;t bear to look on her face as I tell her. I&#8217;d actually be able to see exactly when her heart shatters into a million pieces, and her world crumbles to dust. And I would be utterly responsible for it.<br />
On Tuesday the 29th, Allison has a night class in French. My brilliant plan [insert scathing sarcasm here] is to drop her off at class, and then empty my stuff from out apartment into a U-Haul truck, and leave the Lower Mainland forever. This is not what I would call an ideal solution. But there isn&#8217;t one available. I don&#8217;t want to leave her high and dry, abandoning her like this, but I need my sanity.<br />
By leaving her like this, I become a coward. I&#8217;m too afraid to see what I do to her. I&#8217;m too frightened to bear the knowledge of destroying a person&#8217;s life. You&#8217;ll note, of course, that I don&#8217;t use the adjective &#8220;innocent&#8221;. Allison is as far from innocent as I can imagine.<br />
It started when I arrived in Vancouver two years ago. I came here, hoping that the relationship Allison and I had started might blossom into something wonderful. Instead, it went sour almost immediately. Allison started manipulating me right from the start. We&#8217;d get into a massive fight where I&#8217;d be blamed for doing something wrong that I didn&#8217;t even know I did. The fight would get to the point where I was furious, and I&#8217;d yell. Allison would then cringe away from me, begging me not to hurt her. I&#8217;d walk away, convinced that this was not going to work. A phone call later, everything was dandy, and we continued.<br />
And so the noose started to form around my neck. I let myself be drawn in by Allison&#8217;s ability to convince me that she needed me, and I needed her. I let myself take the full brunt of her pains &#8212; if she was unhappy, I was made unhappy. I had to make her be happy so I could be happy. Her moods were never private &#8212; if she was upset, she would make sure I knew. Even if it was something as simple as sighing loudly in bed ever few seconds, I always knew when she was dissatisfied with something.<br />
My upbringing was always of concern. Because I was not brought up by Allison&#8217;s mother, I seemed to be inferior. I couldn&#8217;t cook like Allison, I didn&#8217;t clean like Allison, I didn&#8217;t eat like Allison, and I certainly didn&#8217;t watch my money like Allison.<br />
In fact, money was a massive problem with us. I spent a lot of money getting myself up and running here. I moved into an apartment with virtually nothing. I needed things so I could cook and eat. And for that, I got in trouble. A lot of it. I got bawled out. How could I consciably spend over $500 in items for my apartment? What gave me the right to do that? Did I know that Allison&#8217;s entire family didn&#8217;t have that kind of money to spend? Did I not care that they were in unions? Did I not care that my debt was killing her? I let her make me feel like dirt.<br />
Trust was a problem. I trusted her too much, and she never trusted me. Even after she moved in with me in Burnaby, there was no trust. In early August, this got to the point where Allison told me that I would never be fully trusted until there was a ring on her finger. Before me, Allison had claimed she never wanted to get married. I never did &#8212; I didn&#8217;t see any benefit, or any point for that matter. But trust was what I wanted the most, and I was willing to sacrifice my beliefs for her &#8212; I proposed.<br />
Things were great for about a month, until Allison decided to quit her job for another one. The new company pulled a fast one on her, and suddenly Allison was without a job. Most people would shrug their shoulders, and find a new job. But not Allison. Her black-and-white view of right-and-wrong dictated that she get even with the company &#8212; get what she was owed. So I became embroiled in a rather nasty fight for money Allison never earned. It was on a contract that she signed, but had never worked for. She spent months working at making this company pay.<br />
Allison took them to small claims court. This also meant she had to serve the company (specifically the two people she fingered) with court notices. But Allison didn&#8217;t want to &#8212; she made me do it. I panicked (I didn&#8217;t want to get into all this in the first place), and didn&#8217;t hand deliver one of the notices. Allison freaked. On me. It took me down like collapsing brick wall. She made me go back and attempt to make sure that the letter was actually delivered. Before I knew it, we were calling the police and claiming theft.<br />
Then winter set in. Allison, who had to constantly look for work (in order to show to the court that she was actively trying to recover from the situation) became depressed. Things hit bottom in early February of &#8217;99. We got into an argument. Over what specifically, I don&#8217;t remember. It took only a few minutes for Allison to reduce me to a bubbling mass of tear-filled nerves. I was an utter wreck.<br />
I had been very upset for a while, not sure of what I was doing. I didn&#8217;t have the clarity of mind to know what I needed to do, or what I should do. I wish now that I had called *somebody* and been able to tell them what happened. But I didn&#8217;t, and when Allison laid into me that evening, she completely broke me.<br />
Allison then excused herself, saying she was leaving. She got up, but her jacket on, said &#8220;goodbye&#8221; and left the apartment. I was so distraut I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. Before I could even lock the door, it burst open again, and Allison started yelling at me &#8212; &#8220;Are you just going to let me leave?!&#8221; &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you?&#8221;<br />
Then she asked me if I wanted to see her die. She told me I could watch her slit her wrists and watch the blood flow out of her. I couldn&#8217;t have been any more upset. Then she lowered the boom on me: &#8220;Will you die with me?&#8221;<br />
I never recovered from that. I still wake up with nightmares. I still shake at the thought.<br />
And I stayed. I have no idea why.<br />
As a result, I don&#8217;t remember much else from last year. I know I was still mistreated, as I am now. The constant orders (not requests &#8212; she seldom asks, and hardly even says the word &#8220;Please&#8221;), using me as a slave (she rarely offers to get things from the store, and even when I&#8217;m sick she doesn&#8217;t want to do anything), and making me a part of all her misery. Even the simple things degrade me. She holds out her arms (as when preparing to hug someone) when I&#8217;m sitting in a different chair. She doesn&#8217;t get up and come over to me, but gives me hurt and pained looks when I don&#8217;t come to her. I&#8217;ve been reduced to Pavlov&#8217;s Dog.<br />
She exercised control over my life that I only describe as near-totalitarian. She nitpicks everything I do &#8212; makes comments about my Observer&#8217;s Logs to everyone I know. If I don&#8217;t make the corrections, I get in trouble. And in the kitchen, Geoff can do no right. I&#8217;m not fast enough, I&#8217;m not attentive enough, I&#8217;m not good enough. I make a mistake, and I never hear the end of it &#8212; Allison makes a mistake, and I let it slide. Why? Because it&#8217;s not worth getting worked up about. It&#8217;s really not worth it!<br />
Then there&#8217;s my personal time. Allison&#8217;s always on my case about taking courses and meeting new friends. But if I decide I&#8217;m going to stay late with people I work with and have fun, people I already know and could get to know better, I get yelled at. Oh, and if I forget to call and let her know when I&#8217;m coming back, I&#8217;d better be prepared for a good skinning, because that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ll get. Heaven forbid I should be late &#8212; especially around dinner time.<br />
And then there&#8217;s money. I already told you about the time I went to IKEA to get some things so I could live. Well, there&#8217;s the issue of Allison&#8217;s obessiveness with debt &#8212; she won&#8217;t do it, under any circumstanes. Allison never wants to be poor &#8212; it&#8217;s some hang-up from when she was a kid. So of course, she wants to show how she isn&#8217;t poor by living a good lifestyle. She wants all the fine things so she can show off to her friends how well off she is. But if she forgets to pay her credit card by one day, she complete freaks, convinced that her perfect credit rating will crumble instantly.<br />
I&#8217;ve since stopped telling Allison what my credit card bills look like. I&#8217;ve spent so much money trying to keep her happy, I&#8217;m actually ill. I&#8217;ve wasted money on all sorts of things, and I&#8217;m tired of it. I&#8217;m tired of trying to make her happy. I&#8217;m tired of not having money to do the things I want to do, and the time to do them.<br />
With all this, you&#8217;d think that I&#8217;d have left long ago. But I haven&#8217;t. It wasn&#8217;t until I spent an evening talking with Allison&#8217;s best friend that I realized that things were wrong. About two weeks later, I made my decision to leave. Now I&#8217;m just waiting to go. And the waiting is killing me.<br />
<strong>24 February 2000</strong><br />
T minus five days and counting.<br />
On Tuesday, I started preparations. I moved several boxes down to the storage locker, and made sure I cound find everything I wanted. Some parts of the apartment I will not need to look at ever again. I know that what I want isn&#8217;t there. I&#8217;m abandoning a lot of things. I consider it making room to allow myself and my sanity to return.<br />
I&#8217;ve had a minor problem crop up &#8212; Stuart can&#8217;t come to help. His company put him on a high-pressue, short-deadline contract that will keep him in Calgary (and likely his office) until March 8th. It basically prevents him from coming here.<br />
Luckily for me, I&#8217;ve got a backup. I took my friend Greg (one of my co-workers) out the other day, and told him what I was doing and the reasons why. I then asked him to help me. All I wanted was for him to give me a hand emptying the apartment. But he offered to help drive. By lucky chance, Stuart&#8217;s sudden inavailability was negated by my saviour.<br />
The planning is mostly done. I need to change addresses on my bills. Some of them I&#8217;ll change when I get to Calgary &#8212; I don&#8217;t want anything leaking early. This means I won&#8217;t be putting Allison&#8217;s name on the bills until I&#8217;m safely out of the province.<br />
Each and every morning and evening when I&#8217;m walking to or from work, I think about what I&#8217;ll do on Tuesday. I think about how I&#8217;m going to get the truck from U-Haul, how Greg (and whatever other helper I can get) will meet at our apartment and wait for me to leave with Allison, how they&#8217;ll get the keys to the apartment, how they&#8217;ll start while I&#8217;m dropping Allison off at her class, how we&#8217;ll load the truck as quickly as possible, how I&#8217;ll make sure there&#8217;s a taxi to pick Allison up (I&#8217;m not completely heartless), how I&#8217;m going to leave Allison a note (and what that note will say), how I&#8217;m going to mail Allison&#8217;s parents a note (because I really feel I owe it to them), and how much I want to get myself out of this mess.<br />
And I think about what this will do to her.<br />
I&#8217;m going to destroy her life. That much is certain. She&#8217;s based her entire view of the future around me. She expects me to be there for her any time of the day or night. She doesn&#8217;t see this coming, and it&#8217;s going to be the worst possible surprise she could ever imagine. If I&#8217;m lucky, she&#8217;ll just cry. If I&#8217;m unlucky, I&#8217;ll get to carry the knowledge that I drove her to suicide. I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m prepared for any eventuality, but I know that&#8217;s not possible. Reality is always far harsher than your best wishes.<br />
Cathy has been so supportive through all this. Mind you, she&#8217;s been on my case for a while for me to leave. She knows I haven&#8217;t been happy for quite some time. It&#8217;s amazing how someone you hated as a child turns into your biggest supporter. My mother had always claimed that we would be each other&#8217;s best friend when we got older. We thought she was nuts. I guess &#8220;mom knows best&#8221; is right.<br />
Mind you, I&#8217;ve found that most of the people I&#8217;ve talked to are supportive of me leaving, though the reason varies between people. For some, they know it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not happy. For others, it&#8217;s because they know the reason I&#8217;m not happy.<br />
I&#8217;m running out of time. There&#8217;s not enough to do everything I want to do before I leave. I need to finish documentation &#8230; I haven&#8217;t the information or the days to complete it. I want to finish overhauling the intranet &#8230; I simply can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m leaving so many loose strings, I&#8217;m actually embarassed. I had been hoping for a simple and straight-forward exit. But I&#8217;m not getting one.<br />
In fact, I had hoped some time ago to stay here for several years. And by all appearances, that was entirely possible. It was one of the two reasons I felt like I didn&#8217;t want to leave Vancouver. I liked it at Radical. It was a good job, with good people. I was respected and well compensated for my time. But when I came realize I wanted to leave Allison, I knew that I had to leave Radical as well.<br />
You see, I&#8217;m worried about what Allison will do. Based on her general habits, and her previous actions, I&#8217;m certain that I can&#8217;t simply walk away. She&#8217;ll come after me, either to just yell at me, or to physically hurt me. I don&#8217;t know which &#8212; possibly both, I guess. No matter how I look at it, I don&#8217;t want to be around here. It&#8217;s too uncomfortable.<br />
Now for the other reason I kept not wanting to leave. Believe it or not, it was Allison&#8217;s family. Irony of ironies &#8212; I love the family, but can&#8217;t stand the woman I was to marry. From the moment I walked in the door, I was immediately accepted and trusted by her parents. (Well, except for the fact that they wouldn&#8217;t let us sleep in the same room for about a year.) I got along very well with both Randy and Jane (Allison&#8217;s brother and sister). I felt like I was part of the family.<br />
They made it bearable for me to exist here. They made it so I had something to look forward to. And it hurt a lot to realize that I had to betray their trust when I leave Allison.<br />
<strong>26 February 2000</strong><br />
T minus three days, one hour and 10 minutes.<br />
I&#8217;m getting scared. I don&#8217;t know how this is all going to work. I&#8217;ve got some more help moving things out of the apartment, and I&#8217;m going to try for one more person. But it&#8217;s the truck I&#8217;m worried about. According to U-Haul, the only carrier who will do one-way trips to Calgary, there&#8217;s no guarantee that I&#8217;ll be able to get a truck on Tuesday. If not, I&#8217;m in deep trouble. I need a truck. I need the ability fork all my junk into one vehicle, and hit the road.<br />
I haven&#8217;t slept well in days. I&#8217;m always tired. I&#8217;ve been living on Coca Cola for a week, and it&#8217;s causing me to have shaking of the hands &#8230; either that, or it&#8217;s the stress.<br />
We watched &#8220;The Story of Us&#8221; last night. It&#8217;s about a marriage that&#8217;s breaking apart. I supposed to most people it would be a good movie (it actually is, at least I think so). But to me, it was like looking in a mirror, watching my relationship with Allison for the past two years. But my relationship won&#8217;t have the happy ending&#8230;<br />
Well, I&#8217;d better get home. Allison&#8217;s expecting me. I shouldn&#8217;t be late.<br />
<strong>28 February 2000</strong><br />
T minus 30 hours.<br />
Yesterday I spent my last sunny day in Vancouver. I woke up late. We got up slowly, and moved with no intention of amounting to anything useful. The day, predicted as rainy, was in fact sunny and warm (it barely broke into the double-digits, admittedly, but it was still nice).<br />
We played with &#8220;The Sims&#8221; for a while (a new game from Maxis, by the creator of SimCity), then decided that we needed to go out. Rather, *I* decided that we needed to go out. I wanted to experience one more good day in Vancouver.<br />
We walked down to the seawall, and walked over to the False Creek Ferry depot. We walked within metres of where I&#8217;d first told my sister that I was leaving Allison. The sun was bright, the breeze scarcely blowing. The water was clear &#8212; we could easily see the starfish on the bottom. People were out walking, running, biking, wandering. It was a good day.<br />
We took the Ferry over to Granville Island, and proceeded to head into the market. We had our favourite, perogies and cabbage rolls. Our server gave us more than the usual amount of perogies, which was fine because they are tasty. We ate outside, in the sun and fresh air, listening to a trumpeter busking in the courtyard of the market. It was a good day.<br />
The market itself was full of people, all looking and buying. All we got was a container of cottage cheese and some strawberries.<br />
By the time we got home, we were a bit chilled, but otherwise fine. The sun was beginning to set (we&#8217;d headed out late that afternoon), and the temperature began to drop. It was my last day in Vancouver. From there on in, all I would (or will) do is work, entertain Allison, eat, sleep, and pack.<br />
I&#8217;m going to miss this city. I never went swimming at the Aquatic Centre. I never went to the Marine Museum, or to the Space Centre. I didn&#8217;t get to spent spring or summer in the West End. I didn&#8217;t get to play softball again. I never got to go skiing at any of the ski hills in the area. I never got to go to the Mining Museum. I never saw Molly&#8217;s Reach. I will never see Allison&#8217;s family again (yes, this is a regret). I&#8217;m going to miss Radical, and all my coworkers horribly.<br />
Change is never easy.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I get by with a little help from my friends.<br />
In this case, it was Stuart and Therese, two of my oldest and closest friends. I ventured to the wilds of Calgary to say &#8220;Hi&#8221; and check out the sights. Well, at least so far as Calgary has sights&#8230;<br />
The flight left Vancouver at 6:00pm. WestJet is not the most comfortable airline in Canada, but when you&#8217;re travelling a mere hour, comfort is a minor issue. However, when arriving just after 8:00pm (Calgary time), I was realizing just how much a comfortable seat makes a difference. Luckily, Stuart was there to pick me up and whisk me away to a comfortable car.<br />
Calgary was cold. Really cold. About -20 C. Okay, so it&#8217;s like the rest of Canada right now &#8212; I live in BC. If it drops to 5 C people start to think the next Ice Age is coming. I&#8217;m beginning to be that way. I found Calgary quite cold, a little too cold as a matter of fact. My nose hairs froze almost instantly (leaving that rather awkward feeling in your nose), closely followed by my fingers and my feet.<br />
Calgary was under a fair amount of snow. Not as much as they&#8217;d had earlier in the week, but still more than Vancouver had all last year. In a strange way, it was neat to see all that whiteness after so long of green &#8230; that feeling faded soon, however. White&#8217;s kinda &#8230; bland.<br />
We arrived at Chez Therese and Stuart about a half hour after leaving the airport. I hadn&#8217;t seen Therese for over a year &#8212; six hours on New Year&#8217;s Eve 1998. That was it. It was nice to be reunited with old friends again. I was promptly fed a tasty meal of &#8230; actually, I don&#8217;t know what to call it except for hamburger casserole, but with ground turkey instead of beef. It was a good welcome.<br />
[Ed. Note: What I did not originally write in the email was that I told Stuart and Therese that I was leaving Allison and Vancouver. They were the first ones to know (I had only made my mind up on the flight to Calgary). Therese, of course, had to be melodramatic and asked Stuart to pinch her. At first, I thought she was going to try and talk me out of it. I was very relieved when I found that they were not only happy, but excited to know I was getting out. There&#8217;s more on this in the next log entry.]<br />
We talked continuously for what seemed like hours. Now that I think of it, it was hours &#8212; Therese and Stuart both had work the next day, and I had an interview with an Internet startup somewhere in Calgary the next morning. So it was off to bed.<br />
But not off to sleep. Although I suspect Stuart and Therese slept well, I had a minor problem &#8230; Tao and Te, their Siamese cats. Siamese are genetically bred not to sleep when everyone does. And their favourite thing to do when other are sleeping is playing. With ping pong balls. All night.<br />
The next morning, I showered and changed into my interview outfit. Therese and I would then hunker down for the 30 minute trip to the University via the Calgary Transit system. It was then I realized just how much I don&#8217;t like cold weather &#8212; it cut right through my business suit. My thighs froze almost instantly. It was uncomfortable, to say the least. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t long before the bus arrived.<br />
My instructions were simple: Take the bus to the C-Train. (That wasn&#8217;t too hard to do, and I had Therese with me in case I got confused.) Take the C-Train to the Sunnyside stop. Walk west from the Sunnyside to 10th St., and turn left. Walk until I get to Kensington. Turn right, and walk until 14th. Look for the old Bre-X building. Of course, it&#8217;s only known as that by infamy. The sign on it now is &#8220;One Nineteen&#8221;. (Although there is a &#8220;Bro-X Minerals&#8221; in the first floor.)<br />
I nearly froze to death getting there.<br />
The interview was an offshoot of an interview I conducted some weeks ago for an article Allison and I worked on. The idea was, in theory, to get a job with an eCommerce company. The interview was a bit odd &#8212; the three guys at the table literally pulled me apart trying to find out what I knew. It was destined not to be a good lead. (And so I found out today, it didn&#8217;t pan out at all &#8212; I was rejected.)<br />
No loss &#8212; it was, if anything, good experience for interview later on. Allison got a good lead on a job at her old company, which not only looked good, but should pay me more. I still haven&#8217;t heard anything from them, but at the very least, I&#8217;ll be better prepared when I go to see them.<br />
After the interview, I went to track down Stuart&#8217;s office. It wasn&#8217;t quite as cold when I left, so I could at least get there without losing the feeling in my extremities. Finding the building (after having to call Therese to make sure I was at the right building), I found Stuart was still knee-deep in work. I hustled out and off to humour myself for an hour or so.<br />
Calgary has built itself around its harsh weather &#8212; the malls cover almost the entire downtown, and you can get around without having to go outside (at least for any distance). Very convenient. This is particularly interesting around lunch, when all the business towers empty into the food courts. It&#8217;s quite strange to watch the flood of people &#8230; it&#8217;s almost like watching an anthill.<br />
I returned to Stuart&#8217;s office at 1:00 for lunch. We disappeared to some weird place called &#8220;Burger Inn&#8221;. They serve, well, hamburgers. And ostrichburgers. Not to mention buffalo, emu, venison &#8230; basically any kind of meat you can get in the province. Good burgers, though&#8230;<br />
Stuart then passed me off to Therese at the University so he could get back to work. Therese had work to finish, so I just hung around for a while until she was ready to go. Then it was back out into the cold to get to the C-Train again. (At this point, I was ready to flinch every time I went outdoors &#8212; that cold is just brutal. Of course, I&#8217;m probably just turning into your typical Vancouver wimp.)<br />
That evening, we were going to go out with a group of Therese&#8217;s colleagues and friends to go see &#8220;Scream 3&#8221; and then go see a band called &#8220;Plastikman&#8221;. Therese&#8217;s car, which had been having a few problems, only made it a couple of kilometres before Stuart had to pull over. Therese had been telling Stuart for roughly that distance that there was something wrong with the car.<br />
Although I don&#8217;t know exactly what happened, it looked like an electrical problem of some kind. Basically, there wasn&#8217;t enough power to keep the engine running &#8230; something that smells like a bad alternator. Either way, we weren&#8217;t going anywhere. While Stuart tried to get the car to start again, Therese and I attempted to get a hold of their friends and let them know we weren&#8217;t going to make it. We were less than successful.<br />
About an hour after all this started, the CAA truck finally showed up. Because the cab was so small, only one person could fit in with the driver. That person was Stuart. This left Therese and I to hike to the nearest warm place (a Safeway) &#8212; about half a kilometre away. Through shin-deep snow. In the freezing cold. By the time we got there, neither of us could feel our feet, and my ears (now exposed to the cold due to my recent haircut) were about ready to fall off.<br />
We were at the Safeway about 45 minutes before a cab finally showed up to whisk us away (Calgary seems to have a severe shortage of cabs in the winter). By that time Stuart had already returned from dropping the car off.<br />
We returned to Therese and Stuart&#8217;s, where we decided to order pizza and watch a movie. This meant going outside again. And into a car that had no heater. I froze. (As you can tell, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the cold anymore.)<br />
We rented &#8220;The 13th Warrior&#8221;, a movie starring Antonio Banderas, filmed in BC, and based on the Old English epic poem &#8220;Beowulf&#8221;. Despite my degree in English, which involved Old English literature, I completely missed the references. That could also be because the movie sucked.<br />
The next morning, we met Geoff (another one &#8212; it certainly makes for awkward conversations when trying to figure out which Geoff is the subject), Jeanine (this is a total guess on spelling, I probably have it wrong), and Sean for dim sum.<br />
Dim sum is one of life&#8217;s little pleasures. It&#8217;s the sort of thing I&#8217;d love to do on a regular basis &#8230; except every time we try, we always end up not doing it. I don&#8217;t know why, it just seems to end up that way.<br />
After dim sum, we traipsed through a local bakery for the dessert we didn&#8217;t get (the dessert cart mysteriously vanished during our repast), and then headed off to the Eaton&#8217;s Centre. (The Eaton&#8217;s is gone, obviously.) Apparently, it was a good day to buy clothes. Everything was on sale.<br />
Not in a buying mood, I followed our little troupe around the mall, looking for anything that might pique my curiousity. Sadly, the only thing I found was a good deal on a CD I seem to have lost a few years ago. I guess I&#8217;m just not the clothes-buying type of person. But that&#8217;s just me, I guess. I suck at fashion (I need other people to dress me), and can&#8217;t buy decent-looking clothes to save my life.<br />
On the bright side, I don&#8217;t spend a lot of money on clothes.<br />
Returning home, Stuart, Therese, and I sat down to watch &#8220;The 13th Warrior&#8221;. Therese had passed out about 15 minutes into the movie the previous night, Stuart joining her about half-way through. So we watched the movie from near its start.<br />
Then it was off to dinner and a movie. We went to Red Devil, a small chain that&#8217;s now in Calgary. It&#8217;s a barbeque joint, priding itself on hot sauces. Overall, pretty good food &#8212; really good calamari (and I&#8217;m not a fan of calamari). We were there for about two hours, laughing, drinking, and eating. It was almost like old times (except that we were missing a few others).<br />
Then it was off to our entertainment for the evening. We opted to see Leo&#8217;s newest flick, &#8220;The Beach&#8221;. Yeah, I know, what possessed us to see that? Well, strange as it may seem, it&#8217;s actually not that bad a movie. First off, this was done by Danny Boyle, who brought us such cinematic gems as &#8220;Trainspotting&#8221;, &#8220;Life Less Ordinary&#8221;, and &#8220;Shallow Grave&#8221;. Unfortunately, this movie didn&#8217;t start getting interesting until Leo&#8217;s character started losing his mind.<br />
Mind you, that was the point &#8212; it&#8217;s very similar to &#8220;Apocalypse Now&#8221;, and features many references to the movie. We were amazed at the number of people who really didn&#8217;t seem to get that point.<br />
Heathens.<br />
We started late the next day. Really late. It was Sunday, and darn it, we were sleeping in. When we finally got ourselves up and running, we went out for lunch to Arden&#8217;s. As in Jan Arden, the singer. She owns a restaurant in Calgary. It&#8217;s quite good, really, and showcases a lot of tasty fare. Best philly cheese steak sandwich I&#8217;ve had since the Copper Penny in Kingston. (Of course, there&#8217;s also Dix here in Vancouver, and it&#8217;s also really good.)<br />
After lunch, Stuart and Therese dropped me off at my relatives, where I could have a chat (albeit a brief one) with my Aunt and Uncle. Sadly, Uncle Mike was off playing basketball, so I was only able to speak with my Aunt Brenda. Our meeting was short-lived, however, as I had to get to the airport to catch my plane. Therese and Stuart reappeared not long after.<br />
The flight back was a little more pleasant than the flight out, although I&#8217;m not sure why. Probably because I was returning to Vancouver. It&#8217;s always nice to return here. It&#8217;s a lovely view from 20,000 feet up.<br />
I&#8217;m home again, and quite comfortable where I am. The sun is out, the birds are chirping, and the only snow is a few hundred feet up a mountain.<br />
I like it that way.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a busy beginning to the year. I think it&#8217;s just a sign of things to come.<br />
You&#8217;ve probably been wondering where I&#8217;ve been &#8212; didn&#8217;t I send all those logs during Christmas? Where are all the ones from January? Well, truth be known, I simply didn&#8217;t get around to them.<br />
Like I said, it&#8217;s been a busy beginning to the year. Upon returning to the Lower Mainland, we had to take Allison to the hospital again. This time it was for a possible infection in her surgical wound, which we had noticed on New Year&#8217;s Day. Allison was also beginning to run a temperature, so the viral experts wanted to keep an eye on her. As it turns out, the panic was for not &#8212; she had the flu. A rather nasty case of it, too. Luckily, Lorna graciously came over and kept an eye on her (and cleaned our apartment stem to stern) while I went to work.<br />
The following week, I started my night course. Once a week for two and a half hours, I go to SFU&#8217;s downtown campus for a class on &#8220;Concepts and Practices of Technical Communication&#8221;. Sound like a beginner&#8217;s level course? It is. My manager suggested it. I feel insulted. I slept for the first three classes, and it was only with the help of caffeine that I&#8217;ve made it through the others. I&#8217;m learning virtually nothing and I&#8217;m the youngest in the class.<br />
Which brings me to my impending change in profession. Technical writing is &#8230; uh &#8230; technical, and &#8230; important &#8230; ah, who am I kidding? It&#8217;s boring me to tears. I can&#8217;t stand it anymore. I want out. Luckily for me, I&#8217;ve had side projects going to keep my skills up in the web. It seems like I&#8217;ve got the right skills at the right time.<br />
I&#8217;m declaring to my manager today that I want out of technical writing. I&#8217;m hoping to become the new web guru &#8217;round these here parts. We don&#8217;t have one, and as recent history seems to be indicating, we could use one. There&#8217;s only one issue &#8212; whether the company thinks this is a good idea.<br />
If Radical chooses &#8216;no&#8217;, I&#8217;m in a little hot water. It basically means that I either stick to the old tried and true (i.e. what I&#8217;m doing now), or I bail out of the company and go somewhere else. Now, if you&#8217;re Radical, and you just denied me my change in career, how long do you think it&#8217;ll be before I leave? There&#8217;s a huge can of worms here just waiting to be opened. (And I just found out that my execution has been stayed &#8217;til this afternoon, when my manager finally gets in.)<br />
I&#8217;m not the only one looking for a change. Last Thursday, Jane dropped by for a brief visit &#8230; a visit with a purpose. She was hoping to talk with a company in North Vancouver about a Customer Service Representative position. The company is Hospitality Careers Online, and they provide a list of jobs in the hospitality industry across North America. Jane had already talked to them over the phone, but her current job called her in on the day she was supposed to clinch the position. So she came over to finish the job (no pun intended).<br />
She called the company early the next morning, but couldn&#8217;t get an interview until 5:30 that evening. Allison and I would pick her up from North Vancouver and take her to the ferry so she could get back to Nanaimo to get to work the following day. Jane performed admirably at the interview, telling them exactly what she wanted and how she felt about moving to North Vancouver. Allison was a bit surprised that Jane had said she wanted to move to North Vancouver to be closer to a good snowboarding hill. No worries there &#8212; the company&#8217;s owner moved there for precisely the same reason. Saturday morning, we learned that Jane got the job.<br />
Last week, Allison took her first night course of the year. She&#8217;s taking French lessons at the Francophone Institute on West 7th. First off, she wanted to take a course in something, so she had something to look forward to each week. Having the ability to improve her French was the sort of thing she wanted.<br />
So three weeks ago, I took her over for an entrance exam, where one of the Institute&#8217;s staff asked her a few questions &#8230; in French. This, unfortunately, was Allison&#8217;s weak point &#8212; she has problems &#8220;hearing&#8221; French. She can read it and speak it quite well, but that wasn&#8217;t the test. As a result, she ended up a level lower than she should be, as was proved in her first class last week.<br />
The amusing part was that prior to her class, Allison was very nervous about being out of her league, that she would be the worst in the class. She couldn&#8217;t have been further from the truth. She&#8217;s sticking it out though, mostly because it lets her practice speaking and listening to French in a comfortable atmosphere, and she&#8217;s already made friends.<br />
Speaking of friends, Stuart appeared here two weeks ago. I got a call on the 28th where an all-too-familiar voice said: &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;d like to order a pizza.&#8221; It was Stuart, informing me that he was coming to Vancouver to take pictures at a private school. He was coming on a short-notice photo shoot for a client, which meant he was also coming alone &#8212; Therese was staying in Calgary.<br />
We didn&#8217;t see Stuart until after 6pm on Sunday. I picked him up at the corner of Davie and Granville, so he wouldn&#8217;t get turned around on my directions (which I was having severe problems making simple, for some silly reason). We went to dinner and played video games at Playdium. It was almost like old times.<br />
The next day we did lunch, prior to his return to Calgary. It was then I concluded that I was going to Calgary myself &#8212; I had to see my friends again. It&#8217;s been over a year since I last saw Therese, and I miss her dearly (as I do all my friends). I&#8217;m going on Thursday evening.<br />
After a lot of debate, we finally bought a new computer. This was the first computer I bought (or at least had a part in buying) that didn&#8217;t come from the store I worked at. It was from a place called Addax in Richmond that Allison recommended. It was a good deal, and allows Allison to work a bit more efficiently than before. It also gave us a good reason to buy SimCity 3000. With luck, we&#8217;ll turn the old computer into a Linux server. That&#8217;s a project on my lengthy list of projects.<br />
I guess that brings me right up to today. Not much else going on, although you can expect another log this time next week.<br />
Until then&#8230;</p>

		<p>T minus 206 days until W-Day.<br />
And so the new year begins &#8212; the last of the second millennium, Ado Domini (or Common Era, if you prefer). It&#8217;s been a rough year for us, with many events having rocked our little world time and time again. Here&#8217;s the brief synopsis of the past year:<br />

		<p>The clock, as they say, is ticking.<br />
In a few short hours, the last few seconds of 1999 will disappear somewhere just off the coast of New Zealand, and we&#8217;ll start to find out what we&#8217;re in for. Some believe it&#8217;s the end of the world, others believe it&#8217;s the end of our civilisation, and others believe it&#8217;s the end of the year. (Allison thinks that maniacs who spell &#8220;civilization&#8221; *incorrectly* (see the *correct* British spelling in the previous sentence) will be the death of us.)<br />
I believe it&#8217;s the beginning of the future.<br />
Sure, we may lose power for a few hours if something goes wrong, but that&#8217;s not going to wipe us all out. Rather, it&#8217;ll be the militants running amuck with a few tonnes of nitroglycerine. They&#8217;re the ones creeping me out. In many ways, I&#8217;m quite glad I&#8217;m sitting here in Nanaimo, away from the big cities. The worst that could happen is that I get stranded here when BC Ferries shuts down due to some unforseen navigation problem.<br />
Predictions are in order for such an auspicious occasion, and I find it hard to pass them up. So here&#8217;s what I think will happen tonight:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few places will lose power, either by some poor programming, by complete fluke, or through some maniac&#8217;s planning</li>
<li>Several thousand people will at some point lose their lives (this will come true regardless of what happens, based purely on the human death rate); whether this number spikes due to artificial designs (see the above-mentioned maniac) remains to be seen &#8212; expect several deaths due to drunk drivers</li>
<li>Hospitals around the world will be deluged by people convinced the world is going to end; there may also be a rush if the above artifical spike occurs</li>
<li>The banks will go on, as will your bank balances</li>
<li>Your computer will still start in the morning, provided you have electricity</li>
</ul>
<p>And my most Earth-shattering prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ll all be disappointed when nothing happens</li>
</ul>
<p>Leave it to the media to psyche this New Year&#8217;s way out of proportion, including the addition of the moniker &#8220;Millennium&#8221;. This is NOT the new Millennium, folks &#8212; that&#8217;s next year. (Don&#8217;t believe me? Answer this question: Was there a Year 0? Answer: No. Result, the decades actually *end* with &#8216;0&#8217;, such as 1950, 1970, and yes, 2000.)<br />
Oh yes, and unless Nostradamus&#8217; predictions come true in the next 24 hours (and I doubt they will [insert sound of me knocking on wood]), there will be no Earth-shattering earthquake that sends us BCers into the drink. (If not, I&#8217;ll have a *really* good story for you in about 24 hours or so.)<br />
So, with that, I leave you to the Most Overblown Festivities of the past Millennium (and yes, that you can actually bank on &#8212; there won&#8217;t be anything worse than this year), and I hope to see you all in the New Year.<br />
Provided the Earth doesn&#8217;t end, of course.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, another Christmas has come and (almost) gone. It was an unusual Christmas for me, mostly because things have changed. My family is bigger than it was, and I&#8217;ve got a few more traditions to start remembering.<br />
The first of these traditions is waking up at 8:00am. Around here, Christmas starts a bit earlier than in Oakville. This is primarily due to Mr. Collins, who was up at 5:00am, waiting for Christmas to begin. His energy certainly makes Christmas interesting.<br />
Collins Christmases are big events &#8230; much bigger than Sowrey Christmases (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with either of them). Waking up to a Collins Christmas means wading through to some place on the couch where you can spend a comfortable hour or two unwrapping presents. It reminds me of my childhood (no doubt in part to Mr. Collins&#8217; enthusiasm).<br />
Even the practice of opening a gift on Christmas Eve continues here. It&#8217;s a practice we Sowreys gave up a few years ago (I don&#8217;t even remember when), so it was a little strange to open a gift last night. But it really prepares you for the next morning.<br />
Generousity is the word around here. In fact, &#8220;give until it hurts&#8221; comes to mind. Over the course of the past 14 hours, I have received the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 CD: Harry Connick Jr. &#8211; When My Heart Finds Christmas (from my parents)</li>
<li>1 DVD: Saving Private Randy Special Edition (from the Collins)</li>
<li>1 Penguin Shaker (I&#8217;ll get back to this in a moment)</li>
<li>2 packs: Ferrero Rocher (3 chocolates to a pack) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Terry&#8217;s Chocolate Orange (Collins)</li>
<li>1 stick: deodorant (Collins)</li>
<li>2 rolls: 100 ASA film (Collins)</li>
<li>1 CD: Will Smith &#8211; Willennium (from Jane)</li>
<li>1 pack: Life Savers &#8211; Sweet Story Book (Collins)</li>
<li>1 pack: Life Savers &#8211; Night Before Christmas (Collins)</li>
<li>1 book: Tom Clancy &#8211; Net Force (from my Nana)</li>
<li>1 bottle: Body Shop shampoo (Collins)</li>
<li>1 bottle: Body Shop shower gel (Collins)</li>
<li>1 bar: glycerine soap (Collins)</li>
<li>1 train whistle (sounds like a real whistle, too!) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Reach toothbrush (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Orange Crush(R) candy cane (Collins)</li>
<li>1 homemade orange bath balm/bomb (Collins)</li>
<li>1 feather duster (I think this was a hint) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 pack: Hershey Chocolate Storybook (Collins)</li>
<li>1 book: The Idiot&#8217;s Guide to Personal Finance in your 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s for Canadians (from my sister)</li>
<li>1 book: The World Encyclopedia of Beer (from Allison)</li>
<li>1 sweater: beige with striping (Allison)</li>
<li>1 sweater: light green (Allison)</li>
<li>1 shirt: button-down plaid (Allison)</li>
<li>1 shirt: funky psychedelic black and white (Collins)</li>
<li>1 game: Motorcycle racing (from the Vailmonts)</li>
<li>1 set: bar tools, including bottle opener and corkscrew (from the Vailmonts)</li>
</ul>
<p>That was just me. (Needless to say, I&#8217;m really glad we brought the car.) Oh, and before your eyes bug out from the length of the above list, I would like to direct you to one little detail: a lot of the stuff on that list is &#8220;small&#8221; stuff, such as candy and books.<br />
Then there was the &#8220;collective&#8221;: Allison and I. Together we received:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 bagel-sized toaster (Vailmonts)</li>
<li>1 pizza stone with cutter and lifter (Collins)</li>
<li>1 spaghetti pot (Collins)</li>
<li>1 set: chip bag clips (Collins)</li>
<li>1 set: matching bathroom towels (Collins)</li>
<li>1 game: Sim Theme Park (Randy)</li>
<li>1 pastry blender (non-electric) (Collins)</li>
<li>3 tins: Misty Mountain Chocolate Paté (Collins)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to list Allison&#8217;s gifts &#8230; it&#8217;s already too much stuff. But like I said before: &#8220;Give until it hurts.&#8221; After this Christmas, Allison and I are going to make a donation to charity to compensate for the abundance of gifts. We are certainly thankful, and want to share thanks with others less fortunate than ourselves.<br />
Now, back to that Penguin Shaker. It seems that Santa made a visit last night that I wasn&#8217;t aware of (my Santa was very good at hiding things so I couldn&#8217;t see them packed into the car). I apparently made her, er, his &#8220;nice boy list&#8221;, and was therefore the lucky recipient of a Penguin Shaker.<br />
What&#8217;s a Penguin Shaker? Glad you asked. (Incidentally, if you haven&#8217;t already guessed, this gets my CGOTY award (Cool Gift Of The Year). Back in the 30&#8217;s after prohibition was lifted, there was a big trend to martinis. The entire movement spawned a style that included penguins (tuxedos; ice). Thus was born the penguin-shaped martini shaker. The basic shape is of a martini shaker, with two wings, and a beak. The beak has a plug at the end that (when unscrewed) acts as a spout; a built-in filter prevents the ice from coming out. It&#8217;s silver-plated and utterly gorgeous.<br />
Following the unwrapping, we proceeded to breakfast, courtesy of Master Chef Randy. Then it was helping Mrs. Collins prepare the evening&#8217;s feast of roast beast. (Okay, turkey, but the Dr. Seuss in me was yelling to get out.) I spent a large portion of the afternoon chopping.<br />
When the rest of the family arrived this evening, we exchanged a few more gifts, and then proceeded to dinner. Not much different than a Sowrey Christmas dinner, except that it&#8217;s a lot quieter here. (Those of us who remember the Sowrey/Sinnott dinners will remember the struggle to gain control of the table&#8217;s conversation.)<br />
After dinner, we all broke up into various conversations. Allison adjourned downstairs for a while to use Randy&#8217;s PlayStation, where Allison totally wiped the walls with me. Allison is the video game equivalent of a pool shark &#8212; she starts off making you feel good, and then cleans your clock. I lost a few layers of skin (not to mention several notches on Ye Olde Ego Meter) when she trounced me 12-0 on Triple Play 98.<br />
I hate sports games.<br />
Okay, so I&#8217;m a poor loser. I get frustrated easily. I like being able to do *something* other than *nothing*. That&#8217;s when I get labelled &#8220;sore loser&#8221;. Things I need to work on for my New Year&#8217;s Resolution, I guess.<br />
Anyway, that&#8217;s a Collins Christmas for you. &#8216;Tis time for me to consider getting ready for tomorrow &#8230; who know&#8217;s what it will bring?<br />
Merry Ho-Ho!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8216;Twas the night before Christmas,<br />
And all through the house,<br />
Not a creature was stirring,<br />
&#8216;Cause they were all at the hospital.<br />
Well, briefly anyway.<br />
Our evening was off to a startled start, after Allison required immediate medical attention. This goes back to last Tuesday, when Allison had to have minor emergency surgery to eliminate some major pain. The incision she received was not sutured closed (as per the type of surgery).<br />
This evening, it gave her a bit of trouble. Allison had been instructed to visit Emergency in the event her wound acted up. As it stands, it was a normal (in the sense that most people who get that kind of surgery often have some kind of trouble) and we went home.<br />
Then it was off to Allison&#8217;s grandparents for the traditional Christmas Eve visit. This, of course, is a new thing for me. I&#8217;ve never been through a Collins (or Vailmont) Christmas before &#8212; I really didn&#8217;t know what to expect.<br />
Singing. I should have seen it coming.<br />
Carols, to many of which I have since forgotten the words; some I&#8217;d never even heard before. Mrs. Collins and Grandma Vailmont were belting out the majority of the lyrics, although we had a small argument about the words to &#8220;Frosty the Snowman&#8221;.<br />
Tomorrow is my first Christmas away from my family. So yes, it does hurt a little. My parents and my sister aren&#8217;t by my side (or me by theirs). And due to Allison&#8217;s aforementioned surgery, we won&#8217;t see them this holiday season at all.<br />
Originally, we had planned to visit Florida on vacation, and would spend some time with them. However, Allison&#8217;s doctor has effectively forbade her from travelling for six weeks (now five). So we had to cancel our flight. Needless to say, I&#8217;m really glad that for the first time, I bought flight insurance.<br />
At least we could travel to the Island, even if we had to sit in the ferry lineup for (are you ready for this?) four hours. And we were there early.<br />
Which reminds me of a detail I keep forgetting. Many of you have wondered when we&#8217;re getting married. You know that we got engaged, but the date kept changing. It&#8217;s official: 26 August 2000. The wheels are in motion. So why does taking the ferry remind me of the wedding? Those of you who will be driving will want reservations so you don&#8217;t have to experience sitting in a lineup for hours on end. It&#8217;s particularly bad in the summer.<br />
Anyway, Christmas is fast approaching. But I&#8217;m doing just fine. Sure, I miss my family, but I&#8217;ve got an extended one here that cares for me. It&#8217;s great to feel wanted, particularly after years of making myself feel otherwise.<br />
So for those of you who get this on Christmas Day, I wish you a very Merry Christmas (or Happy Holidays, depending on which you prefer). For the rest of you, I hope you had a great time.<br />
Expect more within 24 hours&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s nothing better than seeing the look of complete terror upon someone&#8217;s face. Especially if you know there&#8217;s a benevolent force behind it. Such as with a surprise party&#8230;<br />
Allison&#8217;s birthday was on Sunday past. And I wanted to make it something special.<br />
So at the beginning of November, I started contacting her friends, seeing who I could get to come out and scare the bejeezus out of my fiancée. I knew that I had to start early, because it takes a while to plan out all the little details. And it doesn&#8217;t matter how straight-forward something seems &#8212; there are *always* little details.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d organised a surprise party was when my close friends Stuart and Therese announced they were moving to Calgary. I wanted to give them a farewell present, by showing them how much their friends would miss them. The party was as much for me as it was for them&#8230;<br />
Planning it had been a nightmare &#8230; the logistics were murder. While Therese and Stuart were wandering about Europe, I had been pulling together their friends (with the help of Therese&#8217;s friend Rachel and Stuart&#8217;s friend Jay) and planning out all the details. How?<br />
Rule #1 when planning a surprise party: Get the parents involved.<br />
Why? Simple: If you don&#8217;t tell the parents, they&#8217;ll inevitably screw up your plans. Not intentionally, mind you, but they&#8217;ll do something that will make your well-laid plans worth sqwat. (Yes, &#8220;sqwat&#8221;.) So, if you get the parents involved with the process, you don&#8217;t have to worry about things backfiring on you.<br />
That&#8217;s how I succeeded with Stuart and Therese&#8217;s party &#8230; and that&#8217;s how I succeeded with Allison&#8217;s party. The best part is, most parents are clever &#8212; they&#8217;ll suggest good ideas without you have to tell them what to do. In the case of Allison&#8217;s parents, they invited Allison over to Nanaimo for her birthday. This left our apartment open.<br />
So brought about the second problem: How to get people into our apartment to surprise Allison. This took a lot longer than I thought it would, and the ultimate solution was so simplistic I had to kick myself for not thinking of it earlier. Keys. Cut a spare set of keys, and leave them with a friend.<br />
Then it was setting up a decorator, and making sure that our Key Master would arrive before everyone else. Where we would go for dinner &#8230; even a theme for the evening.<br />
But above all else, the hardest thing to do was keep Allison in the dark. She&#8217;s a smart cookie, and it&#8217;s really hard to keep things from her. Especially when it comes to her birthday. Luckily for me, Allison&#8217;s parents were running a good cover for me.<br />
We left on Friday the 3rd, catching the late ferry to Nanaimo. This gave me enough time to clean up the bedrooms. We did this under the guise of not having enough time to clean before Allison&#8217;s aunt appeared on Monday for a visit. (I hadn&#8217;t asked her aunt to come the day after Allison&#8217;s birthday as an added distraction &#8230; it just kinda worked that way.)<br />
But we didn&#8217;t get everything. Allison&#8217;s insistence that we leave negated any argument I could have to clean the kitchen table. I didn&#8217;t want to have papers all over it when her friends showed up.<br />
The wonders of today&#8217;s modern technology no longer amaze me &#8230; I use them with gusto. I made several calls over my cell phone to Michelle (our Key Master) and begged her to clean off the kitchen table before people started to show up.<br />
(There&#8217;s always one thing that doesn&#8217;t go quite right.)<br />
Allison&#8217;s family birthday party was the next day, the 4th. This amounted to a wonderful dinner of salmon, which Allison had asked for. Also on the menu was chocolate cake. This was no ordinary chocolate cake, mind you &#8212; this was the King/Queen of Chocolate Cakes. It was called something like Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chip with Chocolate Whipped Chocolate Filling, or something like that.<br />
It was evil.<br />
In a chocolatey good way, that is. I have never, ever has such a devilishly good chocolate cake in my life. (I&#8217;m actually beginning to salivate, just thinking about it.) I can&#8217;t even begin to describe what was in this thing &#8230; all I know is that it was really, REALLY good.<br />
The next day, we were to leave on the 1:00pm ferry. We would arrive in Horseshoe Bay around 3:00pm, and back at our apartment around 3:30. We would talk, chat, whatever for about two hours, and then go to dinner.<br />
That was the plan. But plans have a way of not working exactly as planned.<br />
The ferry was at 12:30, not 1:00pm.<br />
I started to panic a little.<br />
It was a fast ferry. We would arrive nearly an hour before we were supposed to.<br />
I started to panic a lot.<br />
Miracles of modern technology. I called Michelle, and let her know that things were not as well-planned as I had hoped. We tried to figure out what I could do to stall. I had suggested taking Allison to lunch, but she wanted to eat something on the ferry &#8230; that ruled out lunch at the other end. I couldn&#8217;t take the long way home, as it would make her suspicious. Feigning car trouble wasn&#8217;t even a thought &#8212; BCAA would put an end to that right quick.<br />
Then Allison proposed the solution herself &#8212; she wanted to go to IKEA. That would blow an hour and a half, easily.<br />
So it was with much relief that we bypassed our apartment completely and went directly to IKEA. It was a failed mission, in that respect &#8212; the chair covers we had gone looking for were not to be found. IKEA didn&#8217;t carry them in the style we thought they would. We headed home, Allison a little apprehensive about what I had planned for her.<br />
When we arrived (at nearly 4:30, about an hour late because of nightmarish traffic going back), I made sure to grab all the bags, thus tying up my hands so I couldn&#8217;t open the door. No, it&#8217;s hardly chivalrous. but I had to make sure that Allison was the first into the apartment. As we passed the security camera, I looked, waved, and smiled. Because I knew that the 12 people sitting in our living room were watching Channel 59 &#8212; the security camera channel. They knew we were there.<br />
The elevator was a bit slow, by my heart was racing. It was part anticipation, and part realising that maybe this wasn&#8217;t such a good idea. But it was too late, so I concentrated on the anticipation. The hard part was not showing it.<br />
The elevator took forever to finally deposit us on the 6th floor. I exited first, but let Allison lead the way. As we got to the door, I saw that our weekend paper was still wedged in the mail slot &#8212; our awaiting guests had not removed it. I was excited beyond repair. Allison had no clue what was about to happen.<br />
She got in, remarked that the bathroom door was closed (our friends had tossed their shoes in there). The lights were off and it was dark inside, which was good because if we could see, Allison would have seen some of the snacks left on the counter in our kitchen. But she didn&#8217;t see it. (Mind you, Allison saw the extra jackets in the closet, and *still* didn&#8217;t clue in.)<br />
Then it came. A giggle. From someone in the living room.<br />
Allison gasped. Someone was in the apartment. Someone had broken in, and they were still there! As the onset of sheer terror was about to take effect, a very loud and resounding cry was heard (probably through the entire building): &#8220;SURPRISE!&#8221;<br />
Several camera flashes went off. I&#8217;m told the pictures are priceless.<br />
I nearly fell over laughing. Yes, I&#8217;m cruel. I admit it. It was mostly from pure relief that things worked out, after all. (Although for another 20 minutes or so, I was still a bit edgy, wondering if Allison was all right with everything.)<br />
The group went out to dinner at a restaurant not far from our apartment. Wasn&#8217;t the best overall venue, I&#8217;ll admit, but it was the best choice given the size of our party. The place would probably be more interesting later in the evening.<br />
After dinner, most people went their separate ways. (It was a Sunday night, after all, and many people had to go to work the next day.) But Michelle (our Key Bearer), Mike (her husband), and Tyler stuck around. It seemed that there were other things in the evening that I had not planned.<br />
The evening became organic, developing its own events as we went along. We started off at Commodore Lanes, with some five pin bowling. I&#8217;ve discovered how to beat Allison in five pin: Get drunk. Both of us. Her bowling average goes way down, and mine goes way up. (Otherwise, Allison is virtually unbeatable in five pin.) The five of us had a grand old time being really lousy at many things. Especially table hockey. I&#8217;ve always been a lousy player. And foosball. I got creamed at that.<br />
After our bowling excursion, we ended up at Death By Chocolate on Burrard. One of us mentioned that it was Allison&#8217;s birthday. When her dessert showed up, it had a candle on it. Our server just stood there, waiting. Finally, she said: &#8220;C&#8217;mon folks, work with me here.&#8221; We sang Happy Birthday, and indulged in really bad things for us to eat&#8230;<br />
The day so ended as we headed home. Overall, it was a good day, all stress aside. Now I just have to figure out how to outdo myself next year.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, this was certainly a learning experience. Last week, I sent out a survey (sent to me by a friend) that lets people know how much they know about you. It&#8217;s quite informative. After receiving a couple of responses, I thought I&#8217;d compile them. Some are pretty funny, depending on how you know me. Some are very accurate. These are *completely* anonymous (and in random order), so don&#8217;t be worried that I might single you out.<br />
I started off with the following lyric:</p>
<blockquote><p>Run my name through your computer,<br />
Mention me in passing to your college tutor,<br />
Check my records, check my facts,<br />
Check if I&#8217;ve paid my income tax,<br />
Roll over ev&#8217;rythin&#8217; in my CV,<br />
But you&#8217;ll still know nothing &#8217;bout me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of you guessed it right &#8212; the author in question is Sting. Specifically, the lyric is from &#8220;Nothing &#8216;Bout Me&#8221;, the last track on &#8220;Ten Summoner&#8217;s Tales&#8221; (released 1993).<br />
And so, on with the results! Any comments I supply will appear in &#8216;[]&#8217; brackets.<br />
&#8212;<br />
1. My name:<br />
The real answer is, duh, &#8220;Geoff Sowrey&#8221;. Most of the results were correct. There were a few oddities, such as &#8220;Geoff Sowery&#8221; [note the slight misspelling of the last name] and &#8220;Goff Sowrey&#8221; [note the *intentional* misspelling of my first name]. But otherwise it&#8217;s good.<br />
2. Where did we meet?:<br />
There is obviously no right answer for this one. I met a lot of you in lots of strange and interesting places, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>High school</li>
<li>University of Waterloo, Village Two Residence, South A floor, TV   lounge</li>
<li>High school. Chris&#8217; and my birthday parties</li>
<li>Gah&#8230; University of Waterloo, South A.</li>
<li>235 Gordon Street, Guelph, most likely at a party, oui?</li>
<li>University of Waterloo (more specific?  Umm, camping?)</li>
<li>Arkillago [aka Arkipelago]</li>
<li>113 George Street, Toronto, Ontario [aka Arkipelago]</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Take a stab at my middle name..:<br />
This was a good one. I didn&#8217;t realise how few people knew my middle name. It&#8217;s fairly uncommon (or at least it was until shows such as &#8220;Due South&#8221; and &#8220;ER&#8221; made it a little more mainstream): &#8220;Benton&#8221;. A couple surveys had correct answers. The rest believed it was one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert</li>
<li>propellerhead [??]</li>
<li>Son of Worf [more like a nickname from university]</li>
<li>Patrick</li>
<li>Archibald [this submitter did quickly follow up with the correct name]</li>
<li>Edward</li>
</ul>
<p>4. How long have you known me?:<br />
I&#8217;ve known some of you a very long time (some of you receiving this who didn&#8217;t do the survey have known me since the moment I was born &#8212; Hi Mom! &#8212; some of you not quite as long, but almost). The survey respondants gave me a range of between two and 13 years. One answer was fairly specific: &#8220;8yrs 2mths 7 days&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;m beginning to feel a little older now&#8230;<br />
5. How well do you know me?:<br />
Okay, this is totally subjective. How do you determine how well you know someone? You may know someone quite well, and then they move away or go to school. Suddenly, you don&#8217;t think you know them as well as you did. Things change&#8230;<br />
The respondants were all over the board on this. Some claimed they didn&#8217;t know me well at all (which is to be expected) to knowing me quite well. Oddly enough, no-one claimed to know me well enough to say I was &#8220;predictable&#8221;. I guess that means I&#8217;m doing something right for a change&#8230;<br />
6. Do I smoke?:<br />
Everyone had the right answer on this. However, I will quote one of them, because I thought it was appropriate: &#8220;dear god no&#8221;. One of the respondants did have a good point, though: &#8220;Don&#8217;t think so, then again, you didn&#8217;t drink either.&#8221;<br />
7. Do I believe in God?:<br />
Okay, here&#8217;s a touchy subject if I ever heard it. But I&#8217;m not keen on starting any fires that might take time to extinguish, so I&#8217;m just going to say: If you don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t worry. I don&#8217;t get offended easily. But I do have to quote a reply, it&#8217;s just too good: &#8220;someone has to be held reponsible for creating you&#8221;.<br />
8. What was your first impression when you first saw me?:<br />
This was a good one. This is where the true me starts to show through. Okay, you can all stop laughing now&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>That guy is a looney</li>
<li>What&#8217;s with the sandals?</li>
<li>Son of Worf [just remember me with a beard and long hair]</li>
<li>shy, eager to be friendly</li>
<li>Loves computers.</li>
<li>loud [no comments from the peanut gallery, please]</li>
<li>what a spaz!</li>
<li>very intelligent person, with a few quirks [a *few*?]</li>
<li>looks friendly, not like that scary Justin guy or that shifty little   Jim, and he doesn&#8217;t smell as bad as that Rob guy.</li>
</ul>
<p>9. My age?:<br />
My age (current) is 27 years, 4 months, and 9 days. However, I&#8217;ll take 27 as the answer. A couple put down 26 [thanks for making me feel a little younger], two put down 28 [close, but no banana], and one thought I was &#8220;late gen X&#8221; [AIIEEEEEE! I could be as old as 38!].<br />
10. Birthday?:<br />
The correct answer is 16 July 1972 (I will accept July 16 1972, of course). Some responses claimed it was &#8220;July&#8221; [close enough], &#8220;sometime in the summer&#8221; [sorry, but Alex Trebek would ask you to be more specific], and &#8220;you have one each year&#8221; [doesn&#8217;t everyone?].<br />
11. Color hair?:<br />
Officially, brown. Every response was correct. Luckily for you folks, I haven&#8217;t taken to dying my hair.<br />
Yet.<br />
12. Color eyes?:<br />
Allison tells me they&#8217;re green. I always thought they were kinda bluish. I just stared in the mirror. They&#8217;re kinda greeny. Heck, *I* don&#8217;t know what colour my eyes are. So I really don&#8217;t mind that the replies varied from brown to hazel to blue to green. (Yes, there is at least one person who agrees with Allison.)<br />
13. Tall / average / short / fat / average / thin?:<br />
Most of the answers were &#8220;average / average&#8221;. I guess that was to be expected&#8230;<br />
14. Do I have any siblings?:<br />
One. A sister, Cathy. Most were right (although only a couple knew her name), a few got this wrong.<br />
15. (If opposite sex) Have you ever had a crush on me?: (If same sex) Have you ever been jealous of me?:<br />
This was one of the few questions I was hoping for good answers. My ego running wild, I guess. Either way, all but three respondants completely shot me down (thanks, guys). Apparently, I&#8217;ve never been the sort to attract others &#8230; the nearest I got to others having a crush on me was &#8220;officially, no&#8221; and &#8220;A crush no, but I would say we use to have a close bond&#8221;. Only one of the same sex was ever jealous of me. Oh, and there was that one joker who *had* to write: &#8220;(Ha, ha, ha, ha!)&#8221; [insert sound of ego deflating].<br />
16. Whats one of my favorite thing to do?:<br />
Again, some pretty strange responses here. People have some pretty interesting ideas of what my favourite things are. (Everyone knows it&#8217;s bright paper packages tied up with string&#8230;) Answers included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer stuff</li>
<li>bike really long distances once in a while</li>
<li>make trouble with Stuart with Chris</li>
<li>Play on computer, write, eat ice cream.</li>
<li>play Doom</li>
<li>eat and imbide Guiness</li>
<li>play video games (it used to be Quake&#8230;?)</li>
<li>Watching/talking/re-enacting Star Wars. [I&#8217;m not that bad! Really!]</li>
<li>Used to be watch sci fi, hang out with friends, go to Jack Astors,   ride your bike, and travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Sigh* The things I used to to &#8230; wait a minute, I still do most of those. At least whenever possible.<br />
17. Do you remember one of the first things I said to you?:<br />
This varied for a few people. The most obvious answer was &#8220;Hi&#8221; or &#8220;Hello&#8221;. (I have a tendency of saying that when I meet people for the first time.) However, a few of you received quite different first words:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;What channel is Animaniacs on?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I wrote this program to enhance this computer game&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>Actually, it was a huge rant about running into Chris on your bike,   and getting invited to said birthday party [I was ranting? Me? Rant?]</li>
<li>no but I remember a math textbook falling on my head [This is from my   high school locker victim, er, partner]</li>
</ul>
<p>18. What&#8217;s my favorite type of music?:<br />
Wow. This one was fun. I knew I was going to get some pretty bizarre answers. For record, everyone was correct on this. It all depends what musical phase you caught me in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beatles</li>
<li>Sting, Sarah [Mclachlan], .. whattya call that?</li>
<li>80&#8217;s pop music [okay, what child of the 80&#8217;s *didn&#8217;t*like that   music?]</li>
<li>Rock</li>
<li>ANY bloody type [Technically, the correct answer]</li>
<li>Sting obviously (that should get me the bonus question eh?)</li>
<li>skit songs from Monty Python</li>
<li>new rock (alternative)</li>
<li>you like everything [again, the technically correct answer]</li>
</ul>
<p>19. What is my best feature?:<br />
If it were possible to blush through email, I would. Many of the answers were quite generous. I should have added a question: &#8220;What is my worst feature?&#8221; I think that would be just as telling.</p>
<ul>
<li>very sweet and generous person</li>
<li>friendly nature and honesty</li>
<li>sense of humour</li>
<li>loyalty, selflessness</li>
<li>Down to earth (wow, that was a surprise!)</li>
<li>Allison.  (Ha, ha, ha.) [This is the same joker who laughed earlier]</li>
<li>friendliness earnestness oops thats two</li>
<li>Smile</li>
</ul>
<p>20. Am I shy or outgoing?<br />
Over the past few years, many people have attempted to tell me what I am. There are those who told me that my hyperness was a cover for my shyness. There are those who told me that I come on too strong. It seems that most people can&#8217;t really decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outgoing especially when chocolate is consumed</li>
<li>both</li>
<li>Outgoing</li>
<li>shy, becoming more outgoing</li>
<li>Outgoing most of the time</li>
<li>you think you&#8217;re outgoing, but you&#8217;re really shy</li>
<li>outgone [I take that means I&#8217;m past going?]</li>
<li>outgoing externally, but internally shy</li>
<li>Definitely outgoing</li>
</ul>
<p>21. Would you say I am funny?:<br />
Generally, this was &#8220;yes&#8221;. The range basically went from &#8220;very&#8221; to &#8220;maybe just a little&#8221; [although I detected an ode of sarcasm on that one].<br />
22. Am I a rebel or do I follow all the rules?<br />
This one was nearly as polarised as #20 &#8212; I obviously put across some very different vibes to people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules, unless you are hanging around Chris.</li>
<li>rebel but in an off the wall way</li>
<li>Well, you don&#8217;t follow ALL the rules, so &#8220;rebel&#8221; it is.</li>
<li>a little of both</li>
<li>Middle of the road</li>
<li>rebel</li>
<li>follow the rules (in general)</li>
<li>you think you&#8217;re a rebel, but you follow the rules, pretty much to a   &#8216;t&#8217; [Ouch! That&#8217;s gonna leave a mark&#8230;]</li>
</ul>
<p>23. Any special talents?:<br />
How do you define a &#8220;special talent&#8221;? I never thought of myself having a talent &#8212; I can&#8217;t act, I can&#8217;t draw (at least without the aid of a computer), I can&#8217;t sing (most of you know that). Okay, I can write (most of you know that) &#8230; but write well? That&#8217;s another issue. The respondants thought I had a few interesting abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;out of box analytical thinking&#8221; is not your average skill&#8230;</li>
<li>excellent writer, great imagination</li>
<li>story telling &#8211; in great detail</li>
<li>many. being a great friend amongst them. Computer knowledge too.</li>
<li>Prolific writing, belching</li>
<li>geez, i dunno &#8211; other than programming?</li>
<li>Playing baseball in flip-flops [when did I do this??]</li>
<li>too many to list. certainly not a couch potato</li>
<li>Never-ending energy</li>
</ul>
<p>24. Would you consider me a friend?:<br />
As a rule, I don&#8217;t make enemies. I don&#8217;t like them. So I generally make (and try my best to keep) friends. It&#8217;s not easy &#8230; particularly when most of them live outside the province. Most replies seem to agree with me on that. A few expressed concerns that perhaps the friendship is waning a little due to the march of time, but I think friendship continues beyond that. If you&#8217;re receiving this email, it&#8217;s because of one of two reasons:<br />
a) You&#8217;re family (or about to be family). b) You&#8217;re a friend.<br />
25. Would you call me preppy, slutty, a homie ,average, sporty, punk, hippie, glam, nerdy, snobby, or something else?:<br />
Wow. Some really crazy answers here. I&#8217;ll let them speak for themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are something else alright. You never remained the same for long   periods of time.</li>
<li>wackey, understanding, talented and more.</li>
<li>smartypants</li>
<li>Hmm, I&#8217;ll choose &#8220;hippie.&#8221;</li>
<li>average [two people thought this]</li>
<li>Edgy (when playing Doom with Scott lurking about the house). [The   Scott in question is from University.]</li>
<li>hippie with a touch of nerdy</li>
<li>dog gone nutty</li>
</ul>
<p>26. Have you ever seen me cry?:<br />
Not many people have seen me cry. Those of you who have probably know me better than anyone else.<br />
27. If there were one good nickname for me, what would it be?<br />
Ah yes, the ubiquitous nickname. I&#8217;ve had a lot of these in the course of my life. I wish I&#8217;d recorded them all &#8212; it would be interesting to see how my nicknames evolved as I got older. At the moment, my nicknames appear to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grapes [my old boss gave me this &#8230; still don&#8217;t know why]</li>
<li>Goff</li>
<li>Ge-off [pronounced &#8220;gee-off&#8221;]</li>
<li>Son of Worf [although I haven&#8217;t really gone by this in a while]</li>
<li>Pepe Gonzales [??]</li>
<li>Han Solo [I feel like a scruffy nerfherder&#8230;]</li>
<li>Propellerhead</li>
<li>Celery [wow &#8212; that&#8217;s one I haven&#8217;t heard since I was a kid!]</li>
<li>Macgyver [Yes, like the TV show &#8212; I got that from my dad, although he   wasn&#8217;t in the survey]</li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometimes I wish we celebrated American holidays. At least then we&#8217;d   have one more Hallmark Holiday(tm) between Hallowe&#8217;en and Christmas. As   it stands, we now have a two-month Christmas season. Don&#8217;t fool yourselves,   folks &#8212; Christmas won&#8217;t end until almost New Year&#8217;s. Although at least   this year, the Ol&#8217; Ball Drop will have a little more significance than   usual &#8230; assuming the lights don&#8217;t go out.<br />
At any rate, Christmas arrived in the malls November 1. Yick. Allison   and I can&#8217;t go for walks without seeing Christmas lights everywhere. It&#8217;s   actually sickening. We were flabbergasted that lights were appearing shortly   after Hallowe&#8217;en (at least give us a couple weeks, eh?) &#8212; then we saw   the Christmas tree in the neighbouring apartment building.<br />
Then, of course, there are the commercials. Endless festive, Prozac-infused   spots urging us to run up those credit card bills to buy gifts for those   millions of people on our gift-giving lists. I haven&#8217;t even got to the   Christmas cards yet!<br />
So why all the bitterness? I had to do my Christmas shopping this weekend.   It&#8217;s a new record for me &#8212; I have *never* shopped this early. It&#8217;s not   really relaxing &#8230; there&#8217;s still all the stress of wading through all   the junk to find that special something for those special people I won&#8217;t   see this year.<br />
You see, I&#8217;m not going to Ontario for Christmas this year. I&#8217;m staying   here. Last year, Allison spent a Sowrey Christmas. This year, it&#8217;s my turn   to experience a Collins Christmas. I&#8217;m looking forward to it &#8230; if I can   get through all the sales first.<br />
It started on Saturday. Allison and I darted out to Pacific Centre Mall   to see what things were available for our hard-earned dollars. It&#8217;s not   a great mall, especially since Eaton&#8217;s closed. (I have to say, it&#8217;s a   sad, disturbing feeling to look through the glass doors at the now-empty,   once-proud anchor of Canadian commerce.)<br />
The Saturday run was mostly to see what was available, although we did   find an excellent selection for one part of my family (sorry folks, no   hints). We spotted two other good possibilities, but the mall closed before   we could act on those impulses.<br />
It was then off to our evening entertainment. We had to activities to   choose from: See Kevin Smith&#8217;s new celluloid tour-de-force, Dogma, or   see a local band. The band went on at 10:00pm, which coincidentally was   the same time the movie started. We opted for trying to get in to see   the band, and then seeing the movie if all else failed.<br />
We arrived to find very few scalpers (one of whom was disguised as someone   looking for tickets, as not to give away his shadier motives). Initial   prices were $40. We went for dinner. When we returned, the ticket prices   had jumped to $50. We went into a nearby bookstore. When we came back,   the prices had returned to $40. We were aiming for $30.<br />
It&#8217;s a tricky game, dealing with scalpers. Most of them aren&#8217;t terribly   bright, nor are they patient. Having been through the University of Waterloo,   patience is something I have in abundance. Despite the chilly weather   (and me without my jacket) and the rain, neither Allison or I were willing   to budge on the price.<br />
The tickets were originally $22.50. A scalping company, known as Ticketmaster,   added an additional $5 to the price. We were being nice by offering a   profit of $2.50 per ticket. And when the rain started to fall heavily,   the scalpers agreed. $30 apiece. No movie for us&#8230;<br />
We had tickets to enter a Vancouver legend &#8212; the Fabulous Commodore   Ballroom. This was, until a few years ago, the best place to see any live   music performance. Then it closed down, and Vancouver was cursed with   having no venue for good bands. Then the House of Blues came in with a   bucket of money. Earlier this year, the doors swung open again.<br />
Wow.<br />
It&#8217;s a venue like no other. Art deco stylings &#8212; very 1930&#8217;s. The room   is huge &#8212; easily the size of an Olympic-size hockey rink &#8230; squared.   And then there&#8217;s the floor&#8230;<br />
Rumour had it that the original floor had something like 12 feet of horse   hair under it for springiness. Apparently, it was wood rot (they found   this during renovation). The new floor is in much better shape &#8230; but   just as springy. I&#8217;m not kidding, either &#8212; you can literally be knocked   from your feet in a mosh pit if you bounce out of beat with the rest of   the crowd. The vibration can be felt in the entire room. If an earthquake   were to hit, you&#8217;d probably never know.<br />
Allison and I stole up to the front of the dance floor, taking positions   roughly in the middle of the barricade between the crowd and the stage.   Front row seating, or rather, standing.<br />
The first band was from Toronto, the name of which I now forget. They   were good. Obviously, not good enough for me to remember their name, but   still good.<br />
By the time the featured act took the stage, Allison and I were trapped   against the barricade, desperately trying to hold our position against   all the people trying to force us out. But we held &#8230; it was the best   place to get a close look at Spirit of the West.<br />
We stayed up at the front for four songs &#8230; until some crowd-surfing   moron landed on Allison&#8217;s head. We took a hasty exit before one of us got   seriously injured. (John Mann, lead singer for SotW, later threatened   to refund crowd-surfer&#8217;s tickets and eject them from the premises for   making his &#8220;guests&#8221; leave the front &#8212; he was referring to us and a few   others.)<br />
Four words: &#8220;Home For A Rest&#8221;.<br />
This is perhaps one of SotW&#8217;s most popular songs (after &#8220;Save This House&#8221;).   You could barely hear John over the audience. *Everyone* was singing.   (The only concert experience that beat this was listening to 40,000 of   my closest friends singing along to The Tragically Hip.)<br />
About a dozen songs, a spirited rendition of &#8220;I Got You, Babe&#8221; and two   encores later, Allison and I ducked out before the tide crushed us.<br />
I resumed shopping the next day, considerably less bitter than the day   before. This was a chance for me to rush around and get the bulk of my   family shopping complete. I have to ship the stuff sometime this week,   if I&#8217;m not mistaken. Aside from a hefty batch of Cheezies (don&#8217;t worry   Mom, I haven&#8217;t forgotten this time), I&#8217;m done.<br />
So I&#8217;m a little less testy about the whole Christmas thing now. Maybe   it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve got part of my shopping done. Either that, or I just   haven&#8217;t noticed the 5,000,000 lights erected since last night&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate moving.<br />
I mean, I <em>really</em> hate moving.<br />
As you know, we moved to a new apartment yesterday. Based on the amount of time that it took to move Brian and Gill from their apartment to their house, I assumed (rather stupidly, it seems) that the trip would take about five hours.<br />
We started about 8pm the night before. Allison&#8217;s parents (who graciously wasted two days of their vacation helping us move) arrived and began to help us finish packing. We&#8217;d been packing for nearly two weeks, but due to all the other things we had to deal with we simply didn&#8217;t get everything done.<br />
The next morning, the packing resumed on the remaining small things. At about 11:45am, I headed out to get the truck. We rented a 17-foot cube van, which I thought would be ample to the task of moving our stuff. That was mistake #1.<br />
Traffic was a nightmare. My dear, close friend Murphy was following me everywhere. The rainy season had started in the Lower Mainland, of course on the day we had to move. The lights were out at Nanaimo and Kingsway, backing traffic up for blocks in both directions. I just knew it was going to be a rough day. If only I had known how rough.<br />
Returning to the apartment with the truck, we proceeded to load our lives&#8217; possessions into the truck. I was extremely grateful for the Collins&#8217; help &#8212; we never would have been able to move on our own. Because we were moving on a weekday, we were also unable to get friends to help &#8212; they were all at work.<br />
The idea had been to load the truck by 2:00, get down to the new apartment by 2:30, and have the truck back by 5:30.<br />
That was the idea.<br />
In reality, we had the *first* load ready by 3:00, we were unloaded by 4:15, and back to the old apartment to pick up the *second* load. Fortunately, we&#8217;d lucked out by having Michelle and Tyler (two friends of ours) leave work early to help us move. We stole Tyler going back to the old apartment.<br />
The second load was ready somewhere in the neighbourhood of about 8:00pm, give or take a half-hour. (By that point, it really didn&#8217;t matter any more.) We were unloaded by somewhere around 9:45. After that, I took the truck back, picked up my car, and drove to my new home.<br />
10 hours. It took 10 hours to get it all done. Note to self: Remember this the next time we get the silly idea that we can live someplace better.<br />
As it stands, the apartment is a disaster. There&#8217;s stuff everywhere. It&#8217;s gonna take us about a week to sort it all out.<br />
Like I said, I hate moving.<br />
Next time, we&#8217;re getting professional movers.<br />
And of course, there&#8217;s the aftermath. Rogers botched our @Home installation (we&#8217;re about 1 second away from getting ASDL to compensate for their incompetence). We still have to clean out our old apartment and turn in the keys.<br />
Overall, this isn&#8217;t an experience I want to relive for quite some time. So for the foreseeable future, here&#8217;s where you can reach us:<br />
[This information not available on the web. Sorry&#8230;]<br />
Be talking with y&#8217;all later&#8230;</p>

		<p>The alarm went off at 8:00, and I staggered out of bed. Chris and I had made tentative plans to go for breakfast, but I needed to call him and find out. Chris couldn&#8217;t make it. The whole week had been like that &#8212; we&#8217;d been trying to get together, but one thing after another prevented our reunion.<br />
I returned to bed.<br />
I ran a few errands that morning, leaving Allison in Oakville. The errands took longer than I originally planned, putting me back on time. But I made sure to stop into Canadian Computer on Speers. I wanted to see Chris, even if for only five minutes.<br />
Two years ago, Chris was a computer novice. He hated the things. (Especially the 286 he used for most of his work.) Now he frightens me. I&#8217;m amazed at all the things he&#8217;s learned in the PAST YEAR. Now he&#8217;s an expert. And that meant he was busy.<br />
I got to talk with Chris for all of about 10 minutes. The rest of the time, he was help customers and answering phones. (One of the customers was a teacher from my high school, Suzi Beber, whom I hadn&#8217;t seen since I graduated.)<br />
Then it was over. Realising I had to go home, I bade Chris farewell, and headed home. All the way, I felt fairly numb. I had a huge list of people I&#8217;d wanted to visit with. Most of them didn&#8217;t even get a phone call. (Some people think I have too many friends.) It was too late, though. I couldn&#8217;t do anything more. I saw a few people, chatted with a few more. But it was over too soon. Too fast.<br />
We arrived at the airport about an hour ahead of time. I prefer half an hour for domestic flights, but Allison pointed out that we usually get rushed. I said goodbye to my dad, hugged my sister (my mom didn&#8217;t want to come &#8212; she hates goodbyes &#8212; so I hugged her before we left Oakville), and headed into Terminal 3.<br />
We arrived in Vancouver around 7:30pm PDT following a rather eventless flight. (Not that I&#8217;m looking for an eventful flight.) We grabbed our bags, hopped the Park N&#8217; Fly shuttle, and went to pick up the car.<br />
The car&#8217;s battery was dead. I don&#8217;t know how the heck they got the car there, short of pushing it. You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d have noted that.<br />
Morons.<br />
As we drove home (after getting the car jumped), I remarked on something I hadn&#8217;t noticed before. I felt like I was home. For the first time since I moved here, I felt like I was at home. It was a strange feeling. For the longest time, I didn&#8217;t think I could ever feel at home here. But I do, to some degree at least.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still miss my family and friends. I always will &#8212; you&#8217;re all a huge part of my life. I can&#8217;t forget you any more than I can sever an arm and not notice.<br />
But I was home. I collapsed in our couch, and felt like I was at home. A strange feeling, indeed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Old Man was still cursing the sink the following morning. By the time Allison and I left for Waterloo, the plumber had arrived to solve the problem once and for all. (It would take an additional two hours, and several holes drilled in the wall to finally eradicate the clog.)<br />
The drive up to Waterloo was very pleasant &#8212; it was a beautiful day. I wanted to show Allison where I went to school. The memories were flooding back even before I turned onto Highway 86. By the time I turned onto Ring Road, I was getting some serious deja vu.<br />
But the campus seemed foreign. The students looked much younger (did I ever look that young?), more naive. The university seemed no different than I remembered, with the exception of modifications to South Campus Hall.<br />
After a quick driving tour of the campus, we started the walking tour. This took us from South Campus Hall, between the science buildings, through Math and Computer (I was disappointed to see the Red Room is no longer visible), through Davis Center, back to the Campus Centre (aka the Student Life Centre), over to Needless Hell (aka Needles Hall), through Hagey Hall, and then back to South Campus Hall.<br />
It felt strange walking around. I felt old. Allison commented that an entire (three-year) class had entered and graduated since I left. It&#8217;s a strange feeling, walking around, not seeing any familiar faces.<br />
We left U(W), and drove around Uptown Waterloo, then Downtown Kitchener. We stopped for a while to take advantage of the Oktoberfest that was underway, picking up a pair of rather flavourless sausages.<br />
It&#8217;s kind of ironic that in the five years I was in Waterloo (four years of which I was actually there for Oktoberfest), I only went ONCE to the festivities. (This was prior to my decision to start drinking alcohol, so needless to say I didn&#8217;t have that much fun.) Okay, that&#8217;s not the ironic part. Here&#8217;s the irony: As we headed back to the car, we were approached by a pair of (American?) tourists who were looking for more &#8220;fun&#8221; attractions. They asked this of a guy, who although spent four years in Waterloo during Oktoberfest, had not lived there for over three years. I directed them to the Hans Haas (aka the Information booth).<br />
We headed up to Highway 7 on our trip out to Guelph. Within minutes, we were leaving Kitchener/Waterloo heading east. I had to admit, I almost didn&#8217;t want to leave &#8212; there are many memories for me there, and several people I would have liked to visit with. But there wasn&#8217;t time. There&#8217;s never enough time.<br />
We drove around Guelph, during which I attempted to give Allison a rough tour of the area. I don&#8217;t know Guelph as well as my friends who went to Guelph (or spent a lot of time in the city), but I&#8217;d been there enough times that I knew the area.<br />
Our first stop was at McCrae House. Well, after we drove around a bit before we found it (we took a wrong turn and ended up on the wrong side of the Speed River). McCrae House is the birthplace of John McCrae, author of &#8220;In Flanders Fields&#8221;. We appeared 45 minutes late to go in the museum, unfortunately.<br />
The tour continued up the sidestreets around McCrae House, where Allison oohed and aahed at the beauty of the leaf-covered streets and all the red brick houses. If it weren&#8217;t for the distance, the winters, and the dryness, I figure I could get Allison to move there.<br />
Then it was past the &#8216;X&#8217; House (the &#8216;X&#8217;s are still visible in the window, by the way) on Gordon St. before turning into the University of Guelph. The tour here was fair short, as our time was continuing be tight. We had to be in Acton by 6:30, and I wasn&#8217;t sure how long that would take.<br />
Again, memories. Pangs of regret. The invisible tears of missed friends. They say that smell is the strongest sense that can evoke a memory &#8212; I often find that sight works just as well.<br />
Returning to Highway 7, we continued on our way east. We stopped briefly on the edge of Guelph to get something to drink. I hopped into the convenience store, and purchased a ginger ale for Allison, and a Sprite for me. Well, it was going to be a Sprite until I spied my favourite drink &#8230; Wink. You can&#8217;t get Wink in BC (mind you, you can&#8217;t get Cheezies in Ontario). I took the bottles and presented them to the clerk. I was $0.20 short. I was about to pull the Wink back, resigning myself to never having a visit with an old friend. The clerk, however, said I could pay him back later.<br />
Oh. Okay. Sure. No problem.<br />
Sucker.<br />
We arrived in Acton shortly after 6:00, far too early to arrive at our destination. We were going to Jason and Steph&#8217;s place in north Acton (aka the middle of nowhere) to have dinner with our hosts and two more of my friends, Brian and Gill. Allison had met Brian and Gill before, but I couldn&#8217;t remember if she had met Jason or Steph before. My guess was &#8220;no&#8221;.<br />
Because we were early, I thought we&#8217;d check out downtown Acton. After laughing hysterically about the phrase &#8220;It&#8217;s worth the drive to Acton&#8221;, we decided to visit the company that inspired that phrase &#8212; the Olde Hyde House.<br />
Holy leather, Batman!<br />
I&#8217;ve been in a lot of stores, but I&#8217;ve never seen that much leather before. Ever. We wandered about the store, just to see what they had. Most of it was nice, and I debated off and on about picking out Allison&#8217;s birthday present (she&#8217;s always wanted a leather jacket). Nothing really struck me as &#8220;I gotta get her that!&#8221;. (Sorry, honey, no jacket this year.)<br />
We followed the directions Brian gave me and actually managed to find Chateau Fournier. It wasn&#8217;t long before (most of) the gang was assembled. Jason and Steph treated us to a steak dinner (Jason&#8217;s mom sacrificed her fingers for our meal, accidentally slicing off part of her index finger and thumb on a vicious man(woman)-eating slicer).<br />
Then it was a game of croquano (crocano, krokano &#8230; I don&#8217;t know how the heck you spell it), a game that you could almost call circular curling. If you play it with Brian, it&#8217;s &#8220;kill your opponent&#8221;. Mind you, I&#8217;m not much different&#8230;<br />
It was hard leaving. The memory thing, y&#8217;know. The last time I&#8217;d seen Jason was at his stag; for Steph, it was camping a couple of years ago. I didn&#8217;t know when I would see either Brian or Gill again. It&#8217;s a little sobering when you realise that you have to leave your friends again. You&#8217;d think that after a while, it would stop hurting.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The original plan that day was to go into Toronto. Allison was feeling better, and she wanted to see the various neighbourhoods of Toronto she had heard so much about. That was the original plan, and plans around the Sowrey homestead tend to change without warning.<br />
That morning, it was because of simple request: &#8220;Geoff, can you help me move the chest downstairs?&#8221;<br />
The dishwasher had overflowed and leaked into the basement, leaking onto a chest. Why had the dishwasher overflowed? A plug in the line. Take three guesses what we didn&#8217;t do that day.<br />
We tried Drano. To no avail. We tried a plunger. To no avail. We tried more Drano. To no avail. We tried draining the trap, running a short line to clean out whatever the problem was, filling it up with Drano, and then plunging it. To no avail.<br />
My dad returned with a bottle of sulphuric acid. The reaction between the sulphuric acid and the Drano was pungent, chasing everyone from the kitchen. It did nothing. After my father disappeared to go to his job, I went up to the load hardware store and returned with a drain snake. Even shoving 15 feet of this into the drain did nothing.<br />
Allison suffered the entire time. She wanted to go to Toronto. Instead, she was effectively banished to the basement, and surfed the Internet. All day. For about four hours, I did nothing but try and clear this wretched clog. To no avail.<br />
Dinner that evening was at Cathy and Craig&#8217;s, where I (under the supervision of the master chef Allison) made Indian curry. Mmmmm, tasty. We spent several hours there, making dinner, eating dinner, and talking the entire time. It was kind of weird, when I thought about all the things that had changed since I left for BC two years ago. Cathy had not only left home, but now had a home of her own. Her own kitchen, her own living room, her own yard.<br />
Returning home, we found my father had effectively dissected the kitchen drain. A collective 12 litres of Drano and sulphuric acid had done nothing to the clog &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. Of course, that didn&#8217;t mean that my dad wasn&#8217;t finished. Craig&#8217;s snake went in to try and flush out the problem.<br />
I guess you really had to be there. My old man, sitting on a short stool, hanging onto a short metal rod attached to the snake. He reeled it in, he forced it back. It was like watching a dramatisation of &#8220;Old Man and the Sea&#8221;, although I&#8217;d reword it &#8212; &#8220;Old Man and the Sink&#8221;.<br />
No amount of blowing, sucking, forcing, snaking, or flushing could do anything. At 1:30am, more than 12 hours after this fiasco started, I went to bed.</p>

		<p>Allison was not feeling well the following morning. Jet lag, the flu, a bad bit of food, we didn&#8217;t know &#8212; only Allison was not feeling well. Wednesday thus became a slow day &#8212; Allison slept off her illness, I read everything I could find. And there wasn&#8217;t much.<br />
That evening, we had a family dinner (including Cathy and Craig) &#8212; roast beef. This is my dad&#8217;s favourite meal. He looks for excuses to make it. It was a good meal, and we had a good time.<br />
After dinner, I poked my head into the attic in search of a leak that had formed above the pot light over the kitchen sink. Craig was in there moments after me, and was the one willing to dive into the fibreglass insulation to find the problem. It seemed that my dad&#8217;s brand-new roof was leaking. He was not pleased.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The alarm went off at 6:45am. I was up almost immediately, Allison begged for &#8220;five more minutes&#8221;. I took the opportunity to quickly have some orange juice. Allison was in the shower moments later.<br />
We had to be at Yonge and Sheppard by 10:00am, and the trip would take about an hour. Allison wanted to get there in plenty of time, which meant we were catching the 8:03 GO Train from Clarkson.<br />
My dad delivered us to Clarkson station at 8:00. I jogged ahead of Allison and purchased tickets. After riding the GO Train for a year, I had a kind of sixth-sense that told me we had to hurry &#8212; and the time wasn&#8217;t my only tip-off. No sooner than we had our tickets in hand and were walking up the stairs to the platform did the train arrive. Like clockwork.<br />
The train went express at Clarkson, which meant we were downtown in about 20 minutes &#8212; a feat that is virtually impossible in a car at that time of day. (Of course, now that I&#8217;ve said that, one of you will probably try to prove me wrong.) Arriving at Union Station, we followed the other lemmings into the GO Concourse and into the subway.<br />
The furthest north on the Yonge line I had been was York Mills, where I got off during my tenure at Digital Equipment. That was nearly six years ago. (Six years? Oh boy, I can feel them gray hairs just popping out of my head &#8230; and the other hairs falling off.) We were heading to Sheppard, two more stops beyond that. Allison had no idea just how far north we were going.<br />
We were starving by the time we arrived. Luckily, there was a friendly neighbourhood McDonald&#8217;s on the McCorner. We indulged ourselves with a bit of McBreakfast (which is known to bring on period bouts of McNausea). The McPlace was not even half-full of people, but still took a while to get our McMeal. At first, I thought my McServer&#8217;s name was &#8220;Ebola&#8221; &#8212; imagine getting stuck with that name! As it turned out, her name was &#8220;Errola&#8221;. Dunno if that&#8217;s any better&#8230;<br />
About 9:30, we headed to the building where Allison was to have her meeting. During her departure, I was going to make a few phone calls to obtain information and make a general nuisance of myself.<br />
Allison was up there for two hours. It took me only 45 minutes to complete my tasks. (I also ran out of quarters for the payphone.) During that time, I got a tonne of information about setting up a webserver over an ASDL line, made arrangements for lunch and dinner, made an appointment for Allison at Arkipelago (my old Toronto haunt), and dropped a line to a few friends &#8230; none of whom were at their desks.<br />
That left me with a hour and 15 minutes to be bored out of my mind. I watched elevator load after elevator load walk by, none of them being Allison. After a while, I felt like a dog that watches all the cars go down the road, hoping one of them is its master. (No allusion drawing, please.)<br />
Following her seemingly-successful meeting, we headed downtown to meet with my cousin, Lauren. We went to one of her favourite restaurants, a tiny Thai bistro about a block south from Bloor. We had to wait a few minutes, but the wait was worth it &#8212; the food was good, and not too expensive (for a business-style Toronto eatery, that is).<br />
After lunch, we hopped the subway back down to Queen Street to walk to Arkipelago. It was strange walking down streets I hadn&#8217;t been on in two years. Things were at the same time familiar, but not. It was like someone had taken a picture of my old world, changed a few things, and then shown me the picture without telling me what they had changed.<br />
The familiar smell of Arkipelago was weaker than I remembered &#8230; but it had been two years since I last smelled the aroma of the wood and varnish that permeated the air. The space seemed a bit more cramped, especially with the additional people. When I had left Arkipelago, there were about 15 people. Over 30 people occupy its spaces. The people scattered everyone reminded me of what Arkipelago looked like when I started there.<br />
The meeting was with Diedre, one of Arkipelago&#8217;s newer acquisitions. We had hoped to meet with Tim or Todd, but they were both in Europe. Be that as it may, the meeting went very well, or at least so we thought. Following the discussion (which I was mostly a silent witness), I quickly visited with the Arkipelago veterans who were still there.<br />
We walked down to St. Lawrence Market, so I could show Allison Toronto&#8217;s idea of the Granville Island Market. Then it was off to meet Brenda and Marek at the Movenpick in BCE Place. We enjoyed an interesting dinner and a good discussion. Then we had to split ways and go home.</p>

		<p>If Sunday was quiet, Monday was dead. Being Thanksgiving Monday, it also meant that every store in Ontario was closed. (Stupid Holiday Shopping Act.) As it stood, Allison had work to do. Unlike myself, who was trying his best to distance himself from work, Allison had brought work with her. In an attempt to extend her client base, we were going to visit two companies in search of more work.<br />
One of them wanted a proposal that Allison would present during their meeting. Allison also wanted (well, not really, but she had no choice) to work on a series of factsheets for another company. I set her up on my mother&#8217;s computer downstairs, and let her run free.<br />
I spent part of the day calling friends, seeing who was available and who wasn&#8217;t. Some people I couldn&#8217;t get a hold of &#8212; bad phone numbers, no answer, no answering machine (it&#8217;s nearly the third millennium, people &#8212; get with it!).<br />
We met up with Kathryn that evening. It was so good to see her again &#8212; her insanely busy schedule often keeps her correspondence to a minimum &#8230; as did the long distance phone call she had to make to get her email. (I honestly can&#8217;t remember the last time I sent a snail-mail letter.)<br />
The three of us drove around Oakville in search of a place to have a light bite and a long conversation. After a bit of frustration, we ended up in Jack Astor&#8217;s, ordering bruchetta. The long conversation ensued.<br />
It was good to talk with Kathryn again. She&#8217;s one of my closest friends, even though I&#8217;m lucky if I get to see her once a year. It was pure luck that were in the same vicinity at the same time, so I was more than happy to take advantage of it.<br />
About two or so hours later, we called it an evening, and headed home. We wanted to get to bed a little earlier than usual &#8212; we had a train to catch the following morning.</p>

		<p>The fire was still going the next morning. I don&#8217;t know if they rekindled it, or if the fire had just simply burned all night.<br />
Breakfast was eggs, bacon, leftover ham, and potatoes (not the deep-fried ones, thank Heaven). It was just as tasty as ever. Following our repast, Allison and I hit the road to go home.<br />
We retraced most of our route, including a stop at Weber&#8217;s for a quick hamburger. As we entered Barrie, we spied a familiar-looking RV travelling south. Pulling in behind, we followed my parents until my dad signalled to get off the highway at Highway 89.<br />
Here, we were given directions on how to get to my Aunt&#8217;s. We planned to (briefly) stop by Aunt Ruth&#8217;s place in Caledon East. I hadn&#8217;t been there since April 1996, and was very curious to see how the landscaping renovations had gone. I was also wanted to see my relatives.<br />
My parents weren&#8217;t coming &#8212; they had to return to Oakville. Instead, Allison and I took off across remote Ontario in search of the Lockton Spinney (the name of Aunt Ruth&#8217;s home). They weren&#8217;t there. The home was deserted, only a small fluffy cat (Iggy, so I&#8217;m told) was there to greet us.<br />
I was surprised that I could find my way out of the area with little difficulty. My dad had attempted to give me fairly complicated instructions that involved a lot of turns. I opted for three: turning onto Gore Road, turning onto Old Church Road, and turning onto Airport Road. That got us to the 407, and eventually home.<br />
The rest of Sunday was fairly relaxful. We ate dinner with my parents, and later went out to take in a movie (Mystery, Alaska). After the movie, I took Allison on a short tour of Oakville neighbourhoods. Although I often compare Oakville to Nanaimo, I know there are a lot of significant differences. Most notably, the &#8220;scummy&#8221; part.<br />
In Nanaimo, the not-so-nice parts of town are not-so-nice. In Oakville, it&#8217;s Kerr Street. For those of you who don&#8217;t know Oakville, let me provide a simple example as to what Kerr Street is like. Let&#8217;s say your normal scummy part of town is like a beat-up 1974 Ford Pinto. Let&#8217;s say your typical part of Oakville is like a Rolls-Royce. Kerr Street is like a somewhat muddy Chrysler Neon.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We awoke to the smell of bacon. It must be an instinctual thing &#8212; no human can sleep through the smell of bacon. Your body takes in the smell and promptly yells: &#8220;Get up ya lazy oaf! There&#8217;s bacon to be had! GET UP!&#8221;<br />
Breakfast was huge. Omelettes, bacon, and potatoes. There was also champagne and orange juice (mixed in the stronger-than-usual 1:1 ratio) to wash it all down. When all was said and eaten, we were stuffed beyond belief.<br />
The item of the day was Algonquin Park. Huntsville is a short drive from the massive greenspace, and Allison and I wanted to see it. I&#8217;d never been to Algonquin before (Allison was shocked that I&#8217;d not gone before with friends or family, though that wasn&#8217;t due to lack of interest), and was curious to see what it was like. Allison was itching to see the fall colours (which really don&#8217;t exist here in BC).<br />
The day was warm, so we dressed comfortably. We passed by Huntsville and in just over a half-hour, were entering the south-western entrance to the park. Algonquin Park is huge &#8212; 7,725 square kilometres. Not nearly as large as Wood Buffalo National Park (weighing in at a hefty 44,807 square kilometres), but larger than Prince Albert National Park (3,875 sq. km) and Banff (Bamf!) National Park (6,641 sq. km). We had missed the best time to go through the park (the colour peaked probably a week or two earlier), but it was still magnificent.<br />
After purchasing a day pass from the main gate, we headed for our first stop: Hardwood Trail. This was the shortest one in the park, and was described as &#8220;moderate&#8221;. We took this to mean &#8220;relatively not too bad&#8221;. At only 0.7 kilometres, it didn&#8217;t sound too bad.<br />
In BC, they make trails easy to follow, and will quite frequently build raised platforms and walkways to prevent the trampling and compacting of the ground. In Ontario, they tack little blue circles to trees along the way.<br />
By the time we reached the top of a hill (which gave us a spectacular view over Smoke Lake), we were tired. A lot of it had been crawling up and down hills, carefully walking so you didn&#8217;t plant your foot in a mud pit, and keeping an eye out for rogue tree roots. We passed on any more trails for the day.<br />
We headed further into the park, stopping at the Algonquin Museum about halfway through the park. This gave us an opportunity to view some of the Group of Seven paintings the museum had.<br />
Not far past the museum (still heading east), we realised that we had gone a bit too far, and turned around to head back. Along the way, we stopped at Canoe Lake, site of Tom Thompson&#8217;s tragic death in 1917. The only indication of the lake&#8217;s notoriety was a bronze and blue sign erected near the gift shop and restaurant. I think Allison and I were the only ones who read it.<br />
Following our visit to Canoe Lake, we went into Huntsville, in search of something light to eat. We weren&#8217;t interested in anything heavy &#8212; we were still reeling from the previous night&#8217;s dinner (oh, if we only knew what we were in for). But Ontario is not exactly known for light fare, and certainly not more northern Ontario.<br />
Downtown Huntsville is quite picturesque. It&#8217;s hard to tell if what we saw was genuine, or a carefully constructed charade for the tourists. We drove up the main strip, turned around and headed back (passing my mom and sister in the process) and headed back toward the cottage. We stopped at the Harvey&#8217;s along the way to indulge in a salad.<br />
There were people all over the place when we arrived back at the cottage. As of the previous day, there were 10 people: Cathy, Craig, Dave, Steve, Kathy, Madison (the baby), my parents, Allison, and myself. We now had at least four more (in all honesty, I lost count). So much for a small, cozy Thanksgiving dinner.<br />
Dave had gone overboard with dinner. The turkey was stuffed with apple/raisin/sauage stuffing, there was a ham coated in pineapple/brown sugar glaze (it apparently did a number of the pan), beans that were seemingly cooked in butter (as opposed to water), carrots (the tamest of the items), and mashed potatoes.<br />
No comments about the potatoes, you say? That&#8217;s because it takes a bit to explain them. Take your ordinary potato. Cook a few and mash them with cream and butter. Lots of it. The potatoes should be ultra-creamy. Mix in bacon bits. Real ones. Refrigerate over night. The next morning, scoop out potatoes with an ice cream scoop. Roll the potatoes in flour, then in beaten eggs, then in breading. Deep-fry until the breading is golden brown. Heat in the oven.<br />
I almost wished I hadn&#8217;t learned how those were made. There were sooooo good, but I can never eat them again.<br />
After dinner, we sat around and talked. Craig and Steve set a fire in the back yard. This doesn&#8217;t sound like a bad thing, until you realise what they were burning: Three mattresses, at least one box spring, several table legs (and possibly the tables), and about 1,000 square feet of carpet.<br />
And this was a small fire. Their other fires have been massive blazes that have actually frightened them. (You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d learn&#8230;) Although I don&#8217;t have hard figures, these are some of the other things these people have burned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two vacuum cleaners</li>
<li>One fibreglass jacuzzi tub</li>
<li>Countless square feet of carpet</li>
<li>Countless board-feet of lumber of all kinds</li>
<li>Leaves. Lots of &#8217;em.</li>
<li>Mattresses. Who knows how many.</li>
<li>27 couches. Yes, 27.</li>
</ul>
<p>The neighbours don&#8217;t like the cottage group too much.</p>
