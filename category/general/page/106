	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It was once said that the only thing to fear is fear itself. Fear is the oppressor of souls and nations. It is the beginnings of hatred and suffering. And it&#8217;s what has kept me away from Vancouver. Fear of my past. Fear of opening old wounds.<br />
This is why on Friday past, one year, two months, and four days since I left Vancouver, that I felt it was time to face those fears.<br />
Well, actually, it was a month earlier that I made the decision, but you get my point&#8230;<br />
It basically stemmed from one email I received from my friend Greg, suggesting I come out to see a baseball game in Seattle with some of my former co-workers (and current friends) from Radical. It was part spur-of-the-moment, part &#8220;I really need to get out of this office for a couple days!&#8221;, but when it really came down to it, it was time for me to go back.<br />
I&#8217;d had the opportunity a couple times before, the most recent previous one being an invitation to Katrina&#8217;s &#8220;Glug&#8221; party, a tradition she and Guy have at Christmas. However, I&#8217;d never really felt ready. I had always said I was busy (which was true), but primarily, I knew that mentally and emotionally, I hadn&#8217;t forced off my demons &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t ready to go back.<br />
Rising early on Friday, I made my way to the airport to catch my 7:50am flight to Vancouver. I took public transit, partly for the heck of it, and partly so I&#8217;d get a better idea of times for the next time I do this. Not having the best information available on times and schedules, I ended up with about 20 minutes to wait for the bus once I&#8217;d reached the end of the C-Train line.<br />
I watched the sun rise above the houses, casting long shadows across the bus terminal, and shedding light on a dawn of reawakening. (It&#8217;s amazing the stuff you can dish out when you&#8217;re being philosophical, eh?) It was my first real thoughts about what I was about to do. Would I run into my past, and would she confront me? Would I see any of her friends? And more importantly, what would I do? These were questions I was unable to answer, even though I&#8217;ve been thinking about that very thing for over a year.<br />
Soon I found myself at the airport, awaiting the boarding for the flight. Unlike my previous flights with Air Canada (see [[Christmas in Oakville, New Years Eve in Calgary]]), this flight left right on time. The flight was uneventful &#8212; up, breakfast, read, down. All told, about an hour and 10 minutes.<br />
Descending into Vancouver was &#8230; weird. I recognized everything. Surrey, Coquitlam, Burnaby, New Westminster, the Port Mann Bridge, Metrotown, the Richmond Auto Mall, IKEA. It almost felt like I&#8217;d never left, but at the same time, there was a strange feeling. Something between excitement and knowing you&#8217;re being watched.<br />
BC Transit being on strike, I had to take a taxi to get out of the airport. (Although Greg had offered to pick me up, I had told him not to waste his time &#8212; I knew he already had a killer schedule, and going to the airport is quite a bit out of his way.) The trip was quite, pleasant, and a brisk drive down memory lane. In less than 20 minutes, I was standing on the corner of 10th and Granville, wondering what I was going to do next.<br />
The first thing I did was call Lee, who had been Radical&#8217;s Director of QA and the coach of the Rad Sox. Being already at work, we agreed to meet that night, as planned, at Soho&#8217;s in Yaletown. I so proceeded to step #2 &#8212; wait. I wanted to hold off until about 9:30 before calling Katrina (another friend and former co-worker), but I didn&#8217;t want to disturb her too early in the morning. (More on this in a few paragraphs.)<br />
So it was off to one of a thousand local Starbuck&#8217;s to indulge in my second hot chocolate of the morning (the first being at the Blenz in Calgary airport). I sat, sipping my venti, and really thought about where I was. I actually sat with my back to the door, a little worried about who might walk through it.<br />
Irrational fears are the worst kind.<br />
After pondering the state of affairs for about a half hour (ventis are pretty big), I retreated to the moist Vancouver air, and proceeded to contact Katrina. I had hoped to meet up with her that morning, as I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what I was going to do that day. I had originally hoped to meet up with Lee for coffee, and then visit with Katrina later that morning. However, things don&#8217;t always go according to plan &#8212; Katrina was busy getting all the things she and her husband needed to pack everything in their home so they could move to San Francisco.<br />
I sat next to Katrina for two years. She&#8217;s one of the people I miss most about Vancouver, along with several of my co-workers. They were what made my life there happier than it would have been. But now Katrina was also an ex-Radicalite, and moving on with her life by accepting a position at Pixar. Yes, the same people who brought you the &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; movies and &#8220;A Bug&#8217;s Life&#8221;. Not only am I impressed, but I can actually say I know someone at Pixar. This was too cool.<br />
Resigning myself to having a morning on my own, I proceeded to run errands. First was a quick stop to the bank to deposit a rebate cheque (I had to deposit it in person, and getting to the bank during the day ain&#8217;t easy). I then stopped quickly at Bernard Callebaut to pick up some chocolates as a kind of &#8220;bon voyage&#8221; present for Katrina and Guy.<br />
Then I wandered. I wander well, particularly when I have nothing else to do, and I know (more or less) where I&#8217;m going.<br />
I headed towards downtown along Granville. I decided I wanted to go to Burrard Inlet and look around. It wasn&#8217;t a great day &#8212; the sky was overcast and I was being spit on periodically from above &#8212; but it was good day for looking around. But being in a wandering mood, I made a side trip through Granville Island, one of my favourite places in the city.<br />
On my way in, I stopped to donate some spare change to Jack &#8220;The Bear&#8221;, a self-employed social worker who strives to make his &#8220;group&#8221; (whomever they are) better off. I&#8217;d seen and heard of this guy before, and not being in a rush, I allowed myself (somewhat unwittingly) to end up in a half-hour pseudo-speech. He&#8217;s an articulate man, and he certainly has some interesting ideas. I tried to offer a few suggestions (his ideas, though good, need the odd improvement), but getting a word in edgewise is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s easier sliding papers between the blocks of the Western Wall in Jerusalem.<br />
I wandered about the Island a bit, and went into the market. They say that smell is one of the most powerful memory triggers. The second I walked in the door, it felt like someone was force feeding me 1,000 TV channels at once as snippets of two years suddenly raced through my mind. Some good, some bad &#8230; but after a moment, all I could smell was the produce, and food is always good. It took a lot of will power to get out of the market without buying anything.<br />
I exited the Island via the Aquabus, which ferried me to the other side of False Creek. This was far better than walking all the way back to the foot of the Granville Street Bridge, and then walking all the way back downtown again. I hadn&#8217;t really noticed how much I missed the smell of the sea, not until I got near the water. The smell is unmistakable, and wonderful. I think I was a fish in a previous life&#8230;<br />
The wandering continued as I worked my way down Granville. Not much had changed &#8212; same stores, same buildings, even some of the same people. The city line had a few new condos, and there was the odd old building reduced to a parking lot, but otherwise it was the same. Tagging (a form of graffiti) was very prevalent, especially at the Paradise and Caprice theatres (both now closed). Not unsurprising, I hate to say. The Eaton&#8217;s was open again. A new pub sat kiddie-corner, which had been abandoned or under construction during the entire time I was in Vancouver. A new London Drugs is open at the corner of Granville and Georgia. It used to be book store, which went under when Chapters moved into town. The London Drugs had moved from its old store further down the road, now open to anyone silly enough to lease the space.<br />
Canada Place was seeing some new construction. I had vaguely remembered a plan to expand the pier to increase convention space. The plan, it seemed, was thoroughly under way. As such, my favourite vantage point to view Burrard Inlet was unavailable. Instead, I took up a viewpoint on the promenade between Waterfront Station and the Province&#8217;s building.<br />
Although the view was essentially the same as the last time I&#8217;d viewed it, something seemed different. Not as much life &#8212; it seemed almost a little dead. I don&#8217;t know if it was a changed perspective due to my departure a year earlier, or if it was the weather. It almost looked like someone had dropped out some of the colour from the image I was seeing.<br />
I was still a little afraid, I think.<br />
Through Waterfront Station, and onto Water Street, I walked through Gastown. Not much had changed there, either. A couple stores had moved, a couple closed, and one lot (or building, I&#8217;m not sure which) had been opened up. I think there had been a restaurant there once, but I can&#8217;t really remember. The same burned out husk of a building sat across the street from the Olde Spaghetti Factory, though the structure supports had been beefed up a lot. I shook my head, wondering what on earth was going on there.<br />
I turned up Carrall Street, and headed back towards False Creek, Science World glinting in the distance. In moments, I realized that I&#8217;d made a bit of a blunder. This is what I get for pondering and not paying attention. I found myself at the corner of Carrall and W. Hastings. It&#8217;s known as Pigeon Park, and has the highest murder rate of any location in Canada. It&#8217;s not pleasant during the day &#8230; but you don&#8217;t go near it at night. I briskly walked through and on across the road. I didn&#8217;t feel safer until a couple of blocks later.<br />
I stalled a bit longer (I wasn&#8217;t due at Radical until almost 1pm) and made a side trip through the International Village, a large mall, still mostly empty over a year and a half since it opened. It looks really nice, but I wonder how much money they must lose from the lack of tenants.<br />
Up Abbott, I arrived at Pacific. This took me over towards Quebec Street, and onto Terminal Avenue. I was in the home stretch. Aside from Greg, I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone from Radical in over a year. Fear was rapidly being overcome by nervous combination of excitement and panic.<br />
My first run-in was with Fernando and one of the Foundation developers, whose name I couldn&#8217;t remember, even though he started at Radical the same day I did (my panic began to rise as I realized I couldn&#8217;t remember names). A few moments later, I entered the foyer of Radical&#8217;s new home, and headed right to the top floor.<br />
The receptionist I didn&#8217;t recognize. Lisa was gone, so I find out, having quit back in the summer. Greg could not be found, nor could Joel. Luckily, we could find Neall. As I waited for him to arrive, I heard my name being called by Allison. She had also started the same day as me, but unlike myself, was quite comfortable at her job. She looked good as ever, and still bore the same wonderful smile she always seemed to have.<br />
Neall hadn&#8217;t changed much, either &#8212; though I was just as happy to see him again. The reunions started to come quickly as Dave appeared through the main door, and Fred from the back office. Names were flitting around in my head so fast, I knew I was going to be in trouble. I nearly forgot Fred&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Neall offered to take me on a quick tour, and show me what Radical had moved in to. Having used up all their old space, Radical had taken a lease in a near-brand new building, and had the interior made up to their specifications. It&#8217;s quite nice, really &#8230; especially the log cabin in the common room.<br />
Yes, a log cabin. It&#8217;s their home theatre. I&#8217;ve seen and heard of some pretty wacky things in companies, but this is one of the wackiest. The common room at Radical is two stories tall, and easily big enough to fit a small house. It also has a 270+ degree view of Vancouver, including what must be a magnificent view of the North Shore.<br />
A new building, but it wasn&#8217;t much different than the old building &#8212; totally organic space, managers in the middle, work teams scattered around the outside. Greg had commented that Critical Mass&#8217; building looks more polished, but for the environment, I know a lot of people here would prefer Radical&#8217;s setup.<br />
Eric was still in a dungeon. This is where he likes to be &#8212; in the dark, away from everyone. I assume it lets him get on with his work. Martin was with him, discussing physics calculations. Mark was in the office he shared with Neall, looking none the worse for wear. Across from the office was Jean-Luc and Senta (whose name I sadly forgot, and I felt like such a heel for forgetting it), and a desk away was Nigel. He summed up my return rather succinctly: &#8220;The more things change, the more they stay the same.&#8221;<br />
Down the floor, I ran into Lisa (the office manager) and Cliff (one of the IT guys). I inadvertently interrupted their conversation, but they didn&#8217;t seem to mind too much. Neall took me down a floor to show me around a bit more. There were a lot of familiar faces, but many of them without names. I was now feeling particularly bad about forgetting so many people. It wasn&#8217;t until later that I remembered Yayoi&#8217;s and Rod&#8217;s names, something I&#8217;m not horribly proud of. Jesse seemed a bit surprised to see me, but then I don&#8217;t think he knew I was coming out.<br />
Returning to the seventh floor, I finally found Greg. He immediately started to apologize for not being around. Greg was up to his neck in E3 preparations. The game he&#8217;s working on has to be down there for exhibition, and there were still a lot of issues to clear up. Although it had been planned a month in advance, I hadn&#8217;t picked the best weekend to come out.<br />
Just before lunch, I finally ran into Tim, my old boss. He&#8217;s now one of the VPs (Neall is now the head of Pure3D), although I don&#8217;t know of what specifically. He had always been a fairly serious person while I was there, but he seemed somehow happier. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the haircut, but he looked better off.<br />
Members of Pure3D (Neall, Mark, Nigel) and Pure3D alumni (Kevin, Greg, Gabe, and myself) all went out for lunch, to a place called The Whip. (Gabe picked us up; like me, Gabe is also an ex-Radicalite.) It seemed somehow wrong that we weren&#8217;t eating anything Asian. Pure3D ritual had been typically Chinese. This was definitely not Chinese &#8230; although it was very tasty. The conversation, though, was definitely Pure3D.<br />
The more things change&#8230;<br />
After lunch, I finally met up with Joel. He&#8217;d been a bit of a harder character to find, being the lead programmer for one of Radical&#8217;s projects (meetings being the bane of his existence). He looked tired, like everyone else on the team. Being sick probably didn&#8217;t help much, either. We talked for a while, but I chose to keep the conversation fairly short, as he was busy dealing with the crises of getting a game ready for E3.<br />
I took the opportunity to leave Radical and go visit with Katrina and Guy. By now, it was raining outside, so I was quite happy to find the Aquabus still running between Science World and Stamp&#8217;s Landing, where Katrina and Guy live. They were home, and it only took a few moments (with a bit of direction) to get down to their slip.<br />
Oh, did I mention they live on a sailboat?<br />
This was why it was so difficult for them to get ready to move. Not only do they have to pack their belongings, they have to move their house as well. Logically, not an easy move. But they seemed fairly calm about it &#8212; most people get downright cranky when they move.<br />
I spent most of the afternoon with them, talking for a while, but them helping them pack. It was partly because I wanted to get the skinny on their move. It had come out of nowhere (at least from my perspective), and I was very curious to get their thoughts on it. They were excited. New place, new challenges, and it sounded like a lot of fun. Not wanting to get in their way of packing, I&#8217;d also offered to help them pack. Katrina and I spent the afternoon wrapping things in bubble wrap.<br />
I probably stayed longer than I really should have, but I felt compelled to not just drop in for a few minutes and then bolt. After all, I&#8217;d spent two years sitting next to Katrina, working with her, talking with her, and learning from her. Besides, until I go to San Francisco, I don&#8217;t know when (or even if) I&#8217;ll ever see her again.<br />
At 7:00, all three of us had to leave. Katrina and Guy were going to a friend&#8217;s place, and I was due to go to SoHo&#8217;s and meet up with Lee (and hopefully, people whose names I could remember). Despite being nearly 40 minutes late by the time I got there, I was the first to show. (Hopefully, we didn&#8217;t scare off any other potential revellers.) The second person to arrive was Ryan, a Radicalite whom I wasn&#8217;t sure was there to come out with us, or was meeting other friends. Luckily, he remembered me, and reintroduced himself. I was glad, because even when I was at Radical, I really didn&#8217;t know who he was&#8230;<br />
We talked at length until Lee arrived. You&#8217;d swear no time had passed since the last time I&#8217;d seen her. She didn&#8217;t look a day older, and was just as upfront as ever, just the way we love her. It didn&#8217;t take long for any awkwardness to pass. Soon, we were embroiled in animated conversation, along with one of Lee&#8217;s co-workers, who had also come out. Not too many Radicalites (ex or otherwise) came out that night, although I was very happy to see Lisa (the ex-receptionist) again. I&#8217;d always thought I&#8217;d gotten along with her very well, and had missed saying &#8220;hi&#8221; to her every morning.<br />
Somewhere in the evening, I stopped looking over my shoulder. I stopped looking in the shadows. I stopped being apprehensive. It was like I suddenly knew the story, like I&#8217;d already seen the movie and knew exactly when the creepy, half-dead monster leaps out. It was like the fear had dissipated like morning fog. Sure, the past will always be there, but spending the day in Vancouver, and with my friends, had shown me there was nothing to fear. It was only then that I truly felt relaxed.<br />
Neall appeared around 10:30, and joined our little group. Greg made a brief appearance, only to apologize for not coming out. The debate of where I would stay that night (begun earlier in the day) apparently had been solved &#8212; Neall would drop me off at Mark&#8217;s on our way home in preparation for the next day. This left Greg to quickly go to a friend&#8217;s birthday party, catch a few hours sleep, and get back to work early the next day. Sadly, because of the deadline, Greg wasn&#8217;t coming with us.<br />
Neall and I finally managed to leave SoHo&#8217;s around 12:30. I gave Lee a big hug (we&#8217;d had a good, deep conversation for most of the night, and I remembered all over again why I missed being around people like her), and stepped out into the cool night. Neall and I walked back to Radical, enjoying the walk, and talking about the state of Radical. It was refreshing to see how things had evolved since I&#8217;d left. It was very reassuring to see that management (including Neall, now that&#8217;s he&#8217;s part of the &#8220;establishment&#8221;) still has a firm grip and good steer of the Good Ship Radical.<br />
Fires were raging when we got into the office. A Pure3D patch hadn&#8217;t taken well, and Neall had to help out Vlad (the technical director) to get the software working again. Also, we were giving Eric a lift, and he was still working out a few issues with a demo he was programming. (He&#8217;d been at it since late Wednesday, I believe &#8230; non-stop. He hadn&#8217;t gone home.) Due to these reasons, we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 2:30. This also meant I was now staying at Neall&#8217;s, because it was now too late to go to Mark&#8217;s.<br />
I crashed on Neall&#8217;s couch that night. I was exhausted. I&#8217;d been up for just about 23 hours straight since that morning, walked about 10 kilometres since that morning, ate almost nothing outside of a sandwich at lunch, and was ready to fall dead. I was asleep in seconds.<br />
The alarm came far too early for my liking. But we had to get rolling fast &#8212; we had a baseball game to go to. Although the game didn&#8217;t start until 1:05pm, we had to pick up Neall&#8217;s sister, drive to Mark&#8217;s, pick up Gabe, and then drive to Seattle. It&#8217;s not a long drive, but it still takes time. Although we moved as fast as possible, we were delayed by a mysterious case of nose bleed, which I have yet to explain. (It plagued me the entire weekend.)<br />
After a slight detour to pick up Angie (Neall&#8217;s sister), we arrived at Mark and Carol&#8217;s to switch to a different vehicle. Our trip to Seattle would be in style &#8212; a Warner Brothers edition Chevy Venture. Nothing like being able to play video games and watch movies during the trip. Then it was off through to the west end of Richmond to pick up Gabe. It was almost 10am by the time we were all on our way to the border.<br />
We arrived in Seattle around noon. Mark deftly whizzed us through the various onramps and city streets towards the Port of Seattle, where Safeco Field lies. (It&#8217;s adjacent to the site of the former Kingdome, now the site of the new football stadium.) You can&#8217;t miss Safeco Field &#8212; it&#8217;s big. And it&#8217;s colour is unique for the area it sits in. There I found that Carol wasn&#8217;t joining the game with us &#8212; she was going shopping while we enjoyed America&#8217;s pastime. Unfortunately, that also meant she took the van with her, which contained my jacket. (Upon hopping out, Gabe and I declared that it was warm enough to go without jackets &#8212; Angie and Mark were far wiser, and Neall had a heavy shirt.)<br />
Safeco Field, although new and (assumedly) state-of-the-art, was built in the tradition of the great baseball fields: Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, and Wrigley Field, and Comiskey Park. It&#8217;s also a dedicated baseball stadium &#8212; no other sports (or events, as near as I can tell) occupy the space. The field is grass, and the stands are open to the wind &#8212; only the roof rolls shut to block out the rain (important on the West Coast).<br />
Our seats were at first base, about 20 rows up. Aside from the overhang of the upper deck which blocked the view of some of the flies, they were great seats. We were also one row away from the promenade, where we could find virtually any snack food imaginable, including the ubiquitous hot dogs, but also garlic fries, fish and chips, clam chowder, hamburgers, pizza &#8230; and all by local companies, no McDonald&#8217;s or Versa Foods here.<br />
This was Game 2 in a series between the Mariners and the Blue Jays. The last time I&#8217;d seen a Blue Jays game was about 10 years ago in Skydome, though it might have been 11 &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen so many, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. Almost all of my Jays games had been courtesy of a family friend, Mr. Gairdner, who offered us his season tickets from time to time. I had forgotten in those years just how much fun professional baseball really is.<br />
Well, when you&#8217;re not freezing to death.<br />
I made one major mistake. I left my jacket in the car. I should have been smart and brought it with me. But no, I thought I was fine. Stupid me. I forgot that I was on the West Coast, where the humidity is much higher. I&#8217;m beginning to realize that until the temperature rises into the low 20s (Celsius, of course), it will always be cold for me in the more humid regions of the world. Living in Calgary has dried me out, and my immunity to the cold seems to have waned. I can hack -20 degree weather here quite easily. But minus six in Toronto was brutal at Christmas (I wasn&#8217;t even phased by -20 when I used to live in Ontario), and I was finding that even 13 degrees in Seattle was cold, especially with the wind. I chose to put up with the chilliness, rather than fork out the money for a Mariner&#8217;s jacket&#8230;<br />
The opening ceremonies were a different spin on what I remember from Toronto. Like the Hitmen games I&#8217;d seen last month, Major League Baseball now has games to entertain viewers &#8212; kids&#8217; home run derbies, and pitching contests. Personally, I think it cheapens the game, reducing the game to almost something of a sideshow.<br />
What impressed me was the singing of the national anthems. They brought in the Walla Walla High School Chamber Group. Although American, they sung perhaps the most amazing rendition of &#8220;O Canada&#8221; I&#8217;ve ever heard. It actually brought a tear to my eye. Mark was the only one of us who sang along &#8230; I usually don&#8217;t because my singing usually sends people running for dear life. The choir&#8217;s rendition of &#8220;Star Spangled Banner&#8221; was, sadly, typically American &#8212; seldom sung the way it was written. There are times I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m Canadian, where our national anthem is sung only two ways, English and French, and is always the same length.<br />
I&#8217;m not entire sure how many Canadians were there that day (we saw a few Canadian flags floating around), but there was a fair bit of cheering when Toronto took the field. Understandably, though, the cheering was much louder when Seattle came out &#8230; especially for their right fielder, Ichiro Suzuki. He&#8217;s one of two Japanese players with Seattle, and both are immensely popular, the other being closing pitcher Kazuhiro Sasaki. They&#8217;re good players &#8212; Ichiro hits a mean ball, and Kazuhiro throws a pretty vicious pitch.<br />
The game was tight &#8212; a couple home runs, some really great fielding, good solid hits, and the odd error made for some really good drama. I remembered watching the World Series back in 1992 in the townhouse I shared with roommates Roger, Ed, and Brian, screaming at the mistakes and groaning every hit the Braves made during the sixth game of the World Series, only to later wake the dead (along with everyone else in the complex) as the Jays went onto victory.<br />
Different team, different city, different opponents, and not even a championship on the line &#8230; the emotions were all the same. We all huffed at missed chances, cheered for the really good plays, and whined when the Mariners scored. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t a blow-out for either team &#8212; a good solid race clear through. The only way I would&#8217;ve enjoyed it more was if I&#8217;d been warmer.<br />
By the seventh inning, I was chilled to the bone. Neall noticed my sad plight, and literally gave me the shirt off his back. I knew the four of them were laughing me &#8212; admittedly, I was laughing at myself. Once upon a time, the cold didn&#8217;t bother me. I hate to admit it, but I&#8217;m a damp weather wimp now.<br />
The game ended on a down note &#8212; the Jays lost 7-5. After watching the roof close (which is a bit of spectacle in itself), we worked our way out and tried to meet up with Carol. The only problem was navigating through the 42,000 other fans who were doing roughly the same thing. Fortunately for us, Carol and I were both equipped with cell phones, so after a few conversations, we managed to all meet up.<br />
Departing the port, we headed into the downtown area, to Pioneer Square, and the Elliott Bay Book Store. This is perhaps the coolest book store I&#8217;ve ever been in. It&#8217;s huge &#8212; about the size of a chapters, only with more books. And it&#8217;s in (what I would assume to be) a heritage building. Being from Alberta, buying books in the States doesn&#8217;t really save me any money, so I just took the time to look around.<br />
Hunger soon had it&#8217;s call, though, and we were off in search of food. Unfortunately, no-one was particularly helpful in deciding where to go. We drove somewhat aimlessly around Seattle trying to find a place to eat, all the while asking &#8220;where are we going?&#8221;. We ultimately ended up at 13 Coins, a restaurant Mark had learned about in a travel guide.<br />
One day, I will finally obtain proof that the restaurants that appear in travel guides are only there because the restaurateurs bribed the author. Of all the so-called great places to eat that I&#8217;ve read about, only a couple were actually good. Unfortunately, 13 Coins wasn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
This place had decor that even Elvis would be terrified of. I was convinced that someone had loved the 70s so much, that they refused to redecorate with anything less awful. But when you take into account the &#8220;cheese factor&#8221; of such a place, it&#8217;s kind of interesting &#8230; for a novelty, that is.<br />
The quality of the food, so I&#8217;ve found, usually matches the decor. And believe me, it was pretty darn hard to find something on the menu that I wanted to eat. (Mind you, it was mostly because I was still full from the hot dog, chicken strips and fries, and the tepidly bland hot chocolate I&#8217;d had at Safeco Field.) I settled on a Philadelphia Steak Sandwich, which turned out to be a small piece of beef on garlic toast. Not great, but I&#8217;ve had worse.<br />
The trip back to Vancouver was marked with the showing of &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;. (Note to self: Make sure there is a video system in my next car.) Despite it being one of my favourite movies, I still fell asleep for about an hour or so. The movie ended just as we were pulling into Richmond, and dropped off Gabe. The next stop was at Radical, where I was going to meet up with Greg. I grabbed all my things (I&#8217;d brought my bag with me), and said goodbye. I called up to Greg, who came down to let me in. A quick thumbs-up sent Mark, Carol, Neall, and Angie off into the night.<br />
Greg, along with several of his team members, were hard at work on their game. It was going to be a late night, which Greg immediately started apologizing for. But frankly, I didn&#8217;t mind hanging out at Radical. I always liked hanging out there, even when I was the only one. It was a fun company, and near as I can tell, still is. Greg and I struck a happy medium &#8212; while he coded, I would test.<br />
So for the next four hours, I played a game that no-one will see for about four months. And no, I can&#8217;t tell you anything about it. I will say this &#8212; it&#8217;s a LOT of fun. Greg, like most of the programmers I worked with at Radical, are wizards &#8212; they can churn out some of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever seen or played. This game was no different. Although it won&#8217;t set any new standards for graphics, the game play is outstanding &#8230; definitely better than another game that will ultimately be compared so when it finally ships.<br />
The game doesn&#8217;t wrap up until early August. So why the crunch in early May? The Electronic Entertainment Exposition, known as E3, which is in mid-May. This is when all the Christmas games first appear. This is when game companies try to outdo each other. This is *the* event if you work in the video game industry. And this game is debuting there. Like any good video game project, they were under the gun to tweak enough stuff to make it play really well, and make a lot of people very jealous.<br />
Personally, I think they nailed it perfectly.<br />
Somewhere around 2am, Greg and I headed out for his place in very east Burnaby. We stayed up for a short while and talked, but we were both so tired, we opted for sleep instead.<br />
Sunday morning came around 9:30. I was still exhausted from the day before, but rose and showered and prepared for the day. Not there was much to prepare for &#8212; there wasn&#8217;t much on the agenda. A quick breakfast at IHOP, and we went back into the office. We weren&#8217;t there too long, as I had to go to the airport. This time, Greg drove me out, which I was thankful for (the transit strike makes getting a taxi outside of the airport rather difficult). I bid him farewell, he drove back to work, and I checked in for the flight.<br />
I slept on the way back, though not intentionally. I was utterly wiped. I hadn&#8217;t been so active in so long that my body simply wasn&#8217;t ready for it. I vaguely remember something about 35,000 feet, and something about returning my seat to its original upright position. Next thing I knew, I was hopping the bus home. And as we all know, home is where the heart, bed, and 50&#8243; TV are. This was where I was determined to spend the next several hours &#8230; sleeping.<br />
Unfortunately, it seemed that my vacation would be cut short. Crisis at Critical Mass &#8212; the site I was working on had basically fallen apart in my absence. Somehow, I&#8217;d become the centre of communications, and without me around, everything came to a halt. I didn&#8217;t get home until 1:30am.<br />
I look back at my weekend, and I actually have to force myself to believe I was actually there. With all the apprehension I had towards going back, I now find it hard to believe I did it. But I know I did, and I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad I saw my friends again (despite the fact that I feel like a twit for forgetting names). I&#8217;m glad I saw a Blue Jays game (even though they lost). But most of all, I&#8217;m glad that my past is now just that &#8212; behind me. All that&#8217;s left is the possibility of the future.<br />
Vancouver is a destination for me. Not to live, but certainly to visit. I will see sights I never saw, I will do things I never got the chance to do. I&#8217;m content that no matter what I see and do, it was because of me (with a lot of support from my family and friends) that I&#8217;m capable of doing it. And so long as I know people in Vancouver, or at least have an inkling of a reason, I will go there, and I will enjoy myself each and every minute.<br />
At least when it isn&#8217;t raining.</p>

		<p>Someone&#8217;s out to get me, I swear. Unfortunately, that someone is probably me.<br />
This has got to have been one of the most hectic weekends I can remember. Here&#8217;s the general gist of some of the things that were going on:</p>
<ol>
<li>A project deadline (for our largest client) that was due yesterday.</li>
<li>Several planned family meals.</li>
<li>My mother&#8217;s birthday.</li>
<li>A friend in town.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know it doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but the overall effect was unbelievably distressing, and the victims ended up being my mother, my father, and myself. My father, you ask? Well, I just came the realization that today is his birthday, and I forgot to call. (I have a lame excuse &#8212; I dropped my cell phone the other day, and the antenna broke, pretty much rendering it useless until I get it fixed. I haven&#8217;t had the time to get it fixed yet.) So dad, I apologize for not calling &#8212; I&#8217;ll make an effort to call tomorrow.<br />
The weekend started on Thursday night, with another Hitmen hockey game. I&#8217;ll have to dispense with the details, as much as I would love to recount the game &#8212; it was a thrilling one. It was the first night in a while that I had left the office early. Even without the game, I still would have left &#8212; the power was being shut off to install our server room UPS system. (For those of you who don&#8217;t know what a UPS is, it&#8217;s basically a giant battery.)<br />
The next morning (after attempting to catch up on the weeks of sleep I&#8217;ve managed to fall behind on) Chris and I went over to my cousin Pam&#8217;s new home for a massive family brunch. This included my aunt, uncle, and cousin from Calgary, Pam and her parents, Pam&#8217;s aunt and uncle (who also live in Calgary), her boyfriend, our grandmother (Nana), and my mother, who had flown out to Calgary for Easter. It was also her birthday, which her brother was all too willing to bring to light.<br />
Brunch was huge &#8212; lots of fruit, pastries, eggs, bacon, a spinach pie that was to die for, and champagne and orange juice. It didn&#8217;t take long for Chris and I (and just about everyone else) to overfill. Yes, it was going to be another one of &#8220;those&#8221; weekends (see [[Easter in Calgary, Visiting with Friends, Eating Russian Food]]) &#8212; non-stop food. Luckily for me, I was going to be locking myself in the office, keeping me from eating too much &#8230; in theory, anyway.<br />
Around 1pm, Chris and I made our exit. I had to go to work to work on the aforementioned project deadline. But first, I had to swing by Chinook Centre to get mom a birthday present. No, I hadn&#8217;t had the chance to get her one yet &#8212; and my previous attempts had yielded no fruit. Success was not far away, however, and I was soon heading back towards the office.<br />
I worked away until almost 5:45, at which point I had to leave to go to dinner at my aunt and uncle&#8217;s, in honour of my mother&#8217;s birthday. I made a quick side trip by the Greyhound station to drop off Carl (Critical Mass&#8217;s newest Web Developer) so he could go to Invermere, and then stopped by the apartment to pick up the photographs of Julie&#8217;s wedding (which had been meant to show around, but in the chaos of returning from Ontario after Christmas, disappeared into the &#8220;Behind The Couch&#8221; void).<br />
Almost 45 minutes late arriving, the six of us (my aunt, uncle, cousin Jen, Nana, my mom, and me) had a wonderful dinner. The centrepiece was a Cajun marinated steak, served with a fruit salsa that made the flavours just pop out. I never thought fruit could be used so cleverly.<br />
Around 10pm, my body was screaming for rest. I withdrew my presence and retreated to the comforts of my apartment, where I attempted to fall asleep in front of the TV. However, I was at that uncomfortable point in exhaustion where you&#8217;re actually too tired to sleep. I stayed that way until Chris came home from his almost-but-not-quite date, and suggested we go to Pongo for a while.<br />
I gotta learn to stop doing stuff like that when I&#8217;m exhausted.<br />
The next morning came far too early, despite being noon. I felt like I&#8217;d only slept an hour. But back to the office I went. I slaved away until about 3:30, when I returned home to prepare for the next round of family engagements. We were off to Ron and Dawn&#8217;s home (my aunt Alaine&#8217;s sister and brother-in-law) for a pre-dinner get-together. I was pleasantly surprised to see Jen in attendance &#8212; I had assumed she wouldn&#8217;t have come. But Jen, unlike myself at her age, is quite willing to experiment with new foods.<br />
We hobnobbed until 7:15, at which time we headed en masse to Bodega, a Spanish tapas bar about four blocks from our apartment. I&#8217;d been there one time before, on a pseudo-business lunch, when our office had literally been around the corner. It was an excellent meal, and I was looking forward to having it again.<br />
All 17 of us piled into the little restaurant, taking up a large (and loud) portion of the tables. For the next four hours or so, we ate, talked, drank, shared in Jen&#8217;s drawings (my cousin is becoming quite the artist, and is adept at on-the-spot works of art), and were merry. For a short while, I forgot how tired I really was.<br />
When we finally left (in the vicinity of 11:15pm), I returned to the apartment to pass out. Chris again tried to coax me out for an evening, but I (fortunately) said &#8216;no&#8217;. I&#8217;m not even sure if I heard Chris leave. Somewhere between Chris leaving and the alarm going off the next morning, I&#8217;d managed to haul myself to bed.<br />
I awoke early to get in some work at the office before Easter brunch with Stuart, Therese, and Jordon (one of our co-workers and friends) at &#8220;The Ranche&#8221;, a restaurant in Fish Creek Park in the south of Calgary. It used to be a ranch house back in the day, but is now the home of a mid-upscale eatery. A very filling (and tasty) repast, but a little too long in length.<br />
As we were heading back, my mom called. I had hoped to spend some more time with her before she had to go to the airport, but there were simply not enough hours in the day. Her phone call reminded me that the clock doesn&#8217;t stop. I broke just about every speed limit dropping Chris and Jordon off at Chinook Centre and then hauling myself up to my aunt and uncle&#8217;s house. Not even five minutes after arriving, I was taking my mom to the airport.<br />
Despite her protests, I saw her to the gate. I had seen my mother for a collective 8-10 hours over the course of four days, but had only really visited with her for a small fraction of that. I wanted what little time there was left to see her before she left. Before I knew it, she was passing through security. Three entire days vanished before my eyes.<br />
Returning to the office, I tried to finish off the last of the known work. There were still issues to be solved, but we were having problems with the back-end code, and couldn&#8217;t find the developers to fix it. I continued at the problems until Greg called.<br />
Greg had been in town since late Friday. He had called me on the Saturday, but I had simply not the time to call him back. At 7pm Sunday night, I got together with Greg for a couple of short hours. A few beers, a few conversations and debates over my choice of Academy Award winners (see [[Bowling with Co-workers and a Review of the 2001 Academy Awards]]), and a short walk around town, I returned Greg to his aunt&#8217;s, arriving home at 11:15pm.<br />
Yesterday was a blur. Too many things to do, not enough time. Same with today, which is why I only noticed 30 minutes ago that it was my father&#8217;s birthday, and I&#8217;d forgotten it. So again, sorry Dad &#8212; I didn&#8217;t mean to forget.<br />
But at least Easter&#8217;s over. Maybe now I can get some rest.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<blockquote><p><em>Blepharospasm (n.)</em>:<br />
The repetitive contraction of eyelid muscles in a rhythmic fashion. In some instances, the eyelid may repeatedly close or attempt to close. The most common causes of muscle twitching in the eyelid are fatigue or stress.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how I managed to notice that I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass for a year and a day. Well, not so much the blepharospasm as it was the stress that keeping bringing it back.<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been here a year. I&#8217;ll forego with torturing you with the recap (you can stop cheering now), but suffice to say it&#8217;s been quite the year. Made a lot of new friends, and missed a lot of old ones. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of the rise of Critical Mass &#8230; and I&#8217;m really hoping that I never need to experience the fall. With luck, our management will keep us in check and we&#8217;ll just keep on sailing.<br />
Hmm. I guess &#8220;surfing&#8221; would be a more appropriate word.<br />
So back that that stress and fatigue thing&#8230; This was something I really hoped to avoid this year, but that was one New Year&#8217;s resolution that got shot down in short order. Too much dedication to my job, I guess. Either that or obsession. Not sure which. (Some argue one way, some the other.)<br />
Been working like a dog again (woof, woof). (Has anyone actually seen a dog work? All the ones I ever saw just laid around all day. What I wouldn&#8217;t give to be a dog for a couple days right now.) I keep forgetting that the more senior you get, the more work seems to migrate in your direction. And while I try to pawn as much of it off to others as I can, there are a handful of projects that (for now) only I can do. Blech.<br />
I just hope this doesn&#8217;t get any worse. People get insomnia from this kind of thing. I don&#8217;t get enough sleep as it is without being able to catch a few Zs. Next thing you know, I&#8217;ll be fighting myself in parking lots, being two people, and planning to blow up credit card companies.<br />
But I&#8217;m not my freaking khakis just yet&#8230;</p>

		<p>Who&#8217;d ever have thought that I would one day become the centre of attention?<br />
Okay, be invited to come near the centre of attention&#8230;<br />
Alright! Be allowed to look towards the centre of attention from a far away, but otherwise intrusive distance. Ya happy now?<br />
Sheesh&#8230;<br />
I can&#8217;t remember when I&#8217;ve had a less productive weekend, except when I was either on vacation or was entertaining visitors. But there were no such distractions this weekend. Instead, we were flitting around like we were &#8230; *gasp* &#8230; popular.<br />
It all started Friday afternoon, at just after 5:00pm. A large portion of the company, exact number unknown, all headed down to the Drum &amp; Monkey pub to wish our now former co-worker (but still friend) Ben. Ben&#8217;s off to slightly greener pastures in Edmonton. Ben was a very visible person around here, and a lot of people (myself grudgingly included) will miss him a lot.<br />
So, yeah, we all got drunk.<br />
Ben has a few interesting friends, who also attended the little affair. One of them was the host of A Channel&#8217;s morning show. (A Channel is our local CityTV-owned independent rabble-rousing station.) Ben used to work at A Channel, and had invited them along. I attempted to introduce myself to him. Unfortunately, not only could I not place him to save my life, I was &#8230; um &#8230; slightly incapacitated. It went something like this:<br />
Him: Hi, you&#8217;re some of Ben&#8217;s co-workers, right?<br />
Us: It shows that badly, eh?<br />
(He starts to go around the table, introducing himself, starting with me.)<br />
Me: (A little louder than I normally talk, and slightly slurred.) Hi, I&#8217;m Geoff. This is gonna sound really stupid, but have we met somewhere before?<br />
(I kid you not, that is the first time I&#8217;ve ever used that line. I just wish, in retrospect, I&#8217;d used it to talk to an attractive woman, instead of some guy who&#8217;s name I still can&#8217;t remember.)<br />
Him: (Not missing a beat) Yeah, I used to buy all that LSD from you out behind the Cecil!<br />
Me: (Surprisingly also not missing a beat &#8212; yeah, I know, it&#8217;s rare, but it does happen) No, I sold heroin. I don&#8217;t deal with that wimpy sh*t.<br />
Him: Yeah yeah yeah! I remember now &#8212; sorry, I was usually too stoned to notice.<br />
Me: Not a problem, you get used to it in my line of work.<br />
For the record, I have never dealt any form of drug (illicit, or otherwise), nor have I sampled anything but alcohol.<br />
I hopped tables most of the night, wandering from conversation to conversation (participating for a while in a semi-strategic discussion with George (one of our account managers), and the guy from A Channel &#8212; he must think I&#8217;m a total freak by now), meeting new people (most of whom I&#8217;ve now forgotten), and generally causing trouble. But hey, what else are you gonna do when you&#8217;re out getting drunk?<br />
We all started departing around 10:45 or so (I really don&#8217;t know what time it was, I&#8217;m just taking estimates from when I first saw the clock when I finally got home). A small number of us were heading over to a place called Calypso&#8217;s, which is one of the white trash bars in Calgary. Luckily positioned right next door to our apartment building. Why there? Easy: Karaoke.<br />
No, I didn&#8217;t sing. Aside from the fact that I can&#8217;t (and have a serious case of stage fright), I was also crashing fast. Even with a caffeinated beverage to attempt to offset the sleepiness, I was at home shortly after 11:30. Chris, on the other hand, was ready for Phase II of the evening (he had left the Drum &amp; Monkey a little earlier) &#8212; he was going to meet with the people at Calypso&#8217;s.<br />
The following day was marked with me at work. (There&#8217;s a surprise.) But only for three hours. Then it was back home to prepare for the evening &#8212; we had a birthday to go to. But first, we decided to go see a movie (Spy Kids &#8212; yeah, it&#8217;s a kid&#8217;s movie, but it&#8217;s a good, funny kids movie) with our friend (and co-worker) Tamara.<br />
After the movie, Chris and I walked over to Kensington for Chrissie&#8217;s birthday. Chrissie is one of our Project Managers, and though we really don&#8217;t know her that well, we thought it would be fun. But first, it was over to Safeway. Just as we reached the bridge to cross the Bow River, I suddenly realized that we had no gift to bring [insert bad &#8220;Little Drummer Boy&#8221; joke here]. So did Chris, only he had a good idea &#8212; flowers. So instead of going directly to Bass Brothers (the pub where Chrissie&#8217;s birthday celebration was in full swing), we stopped by Safeway to pick up some white roses.<br />
The roses were &#8230; well, Chrissie told us that she was going to make a lot of phone calls today and brag. I&#8217;ll let you pick your own description as to how happy/overjoyed/ecstatic she was. Either way, it scored major brownie points for Chris and I &#8230; now we just gotta use &#8217;em while they&#8217;re still good.<br />
We hung out at the pub for about two hours or so, before deciding to keep on going. You see, for perhaps the first time in my life (I&#8217;m not sure about Chris), we actually had multiple invitations (okay, two), and we didn&#8217;t want to disappoint.<br />
Arif, our other inviter, had said that the second soiree of the night wouldn&#8217;t get moving until midnight. Chris and I took the opportunity to get something to eat at Pongo&#8217;s first, before braving the wilds of a party where we knew two people.<br />
We arrived at Arif&#8217;s friend Kim&#8217;s house around 1:30 or so. (Yes, in the morning.) It was packed with strange people. So naturally, we fit right in. We mingled as best we could, but it wouldn&#8217;t be until later in the evening that I found I was able to mingle without being near Chris (unlike my friend, I find a bit of libation takes the edge of my awkwardness).<br />
We arrived home just before 5:00am. (Technically 4:00am, but there was that goofy time change. I wish we&#8217;d just get rid of that.) I promptly passed out.<br />
My alarm went off at 10:30. I was so not ready for it. But it was a dim sum morning, and there are some things that are worth getting up for. We met Jordon (yet another co-worker and friend), and Stuart and Therese at Silver Dragon, where we promptly disposed of a dangerously high stock of delicious bite-sized Chinese edibles. This, for us, is almost a ritual now. But it&#8217;s one, that unless I&#8217;m mistaken, is beginning to become too routine. It&#8217;s almost to the point where I &#8230; and I shudder to say this &#8230; don&#8217;t want to have it every Sunday. I actually think I&#8217;ve had it too much.<br />
Following dim sum, the four of them went off for their afternoon (Therese to work, and the other three to no good) and I went off to the Calgary Hitmen hockey game.<br />
This was the sixth (and potentially deciding) game in the series. You could certainly tell that there were a lot of very avidly interested people (9,022 in all, according to attendance figures) going &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t miss the cars and pedestrians. No-one cared that there&#8217;s been a transit strike here for about a month &#8212; they still showed up in droves. The Saddledome wasn&#8217;t packed &#8212; but considering it&#8217;s minor league hockey, it was a solid turnout.<br />
Before I continue, a couple of corrections. Some of the Observer&#8217;s Log&#8217;s avid readers caught me on my knowledge of hockey. I would like to state, for the records, that I know sqwat about sports. I went to the first game because it sounded like fun. I went to the second game because the first one *was* fun.<br />
First off, the Hitmen and the Pats play in the Western Hockey League, not the World Hockey League, as I had originally assumed. My bad. As for the Pats, their name has a long history. To save myself a heap of typing, I&#8217;ll just take Joel&#8217;s explanation:<br />
The Regina Pats Hockey Club is the oldest major junior hockey franchise in existence, first stepping on the ice in 1917. Over the past 82 years, there have been several stories as to how the team got its name, but the truth is the name came from both Princess Patricia, granddaughter of Queen Victoria (this is also where the Princess Patricia&#8217;s Canadian Light Infantry Regiment, organized at the outbreak of World War I, got its name). A top-level junior hockey team began play in Regina in 1917, and went by the name &#8220;Patricias&#8221; until 1923, when it was shortened to &#8220;Pats&#8221;. The hockey club won the Memorial Cup for junior hockey supremacy in 1925 under the guidance of the legendary Al Ritchie.<br />
So there you go, and now you know. Joel also added that he&#8217;s also not a hockey fan, but had been to Pats games. His reasoning being: &#8220;What else is there to do growing up on the Prairies?&#8221;<br />
I think that explains the crowd in the Saddledome. The noise was booming even before the game started. But once it did, it became a madhouse. The Hitmen literally exploded in the first 15 minutes of the game, and the Pats looked like there were trying to fight off an angry pack of rottweilers. (I can only assume this was partly due to the cheap shot one of the Pats had made at the end of the last Calgary game, and because the Hitmen really wanted to wrap this series up.) The first period ended in a 1-1 tie.<br />
The audience was revved. Toronto Blue Jays fans are quiet folk. Calgary Hitmen fans are not &#8212; you should hear 9,000 people in the Saddledome cheering on minor league hockey. It&#8217;s unreal. Not to mention deafening.<br />
Like the previous game, the breaks between plays were interspersed with contests and prize giveaways (I can only assume to entice people to come out &#8212; it&#8217;s otherwise distracting from the game). During the first intermission, they had even more entertainment &#8212; former WWF wrestler Brett &#8220;The Hitman&#8221; Hart against a pack of angry 10-year-old midget hockey players. They had to flip him on his back, for some goofy reason.<br />
Hockey&#8217;s a strange sport.<br />
The second period could only be described as an utter disaster. The Hitmen had more or less fallen apart. Although they got another goal, the Pats got two. And the Pats were the ones in control. They were swarming. They were passing. They were making the Hitmen really angry, and the Hitmen were responding &#8230; with penalties. A lot of &#8217;em. That&#8217;s how the Pats pulled ahead.<br />
It affected the crowd, too. They started to get quieter. Even when one of the Hitmen managed to get the puck and skate towards the Pats&#8217; goal, the now-normal rise in cheering was more subdued. The energy was gone.<br />
Something happened during the second intermission in the Hitmen&#8217;s locker room. I don&#8217;t know what the coach said, or what performance-enhancing drugs they took, but the Hitmen were breathing fire when they came back out on the ice. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen as good hockey played &#8230; ever. The first 13 minutes of the third period were really good &#8212; the crowd noticed too. But the energy in the crowd&#8217;s cheering didn&#8217;t come back.<br />
Not until Brendl scored a the tying goal at 13:15 in the period. No-one was sitting down. You could barely hear the announcer. Now the crowd got loud.<br />
The chanting was deafening. I actually felt a little sorry for the Pats. You could see the Hitmen actually playing better the louder the crowd got. All you could hear was &#8220;Go Hitmen, Go!&#8221; and rhythmic thumping through the stands. People were cheering, crying, roaring &#8230; and going hoarse very quickly.<br />
The game intensified &#8212; playoff Olympic hockey isn&#8217;t this good. The puck changed ends constantly. The Hitmen wanted to win the game to finish the series. The Pats wanted to win to stay alive. Both wanted the game, bad.<br />
With less than a minute left, I was really to call for overtime. But I didn&#8217;t, and I don&#8217;t know why. It&#8217;s probably a good thing, too. With less than 15 seconds left in the game, Brendl swooped down the ice, swerved around the Pats&#8217; defenders, and scooped the puck in the net.<br />
I, like every other capable person in the Saddledome, flew out of my seat. Not only did I nearly wrench my right arm out of its socket (still not sure how I did that), but I could feel my vocal chords tearing apart from my unearthly screaming. My ears were ringing. You couldn&#8217;t hear anything &#8212; not even the overly-loud high-bass music. All you could hear were the blood-curdling screams and ear-piercing whistles of 9,000 crazed fans.<br />
That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that you weren&#8217;t already deaf.<br />
No-one sat down for the last 15 seconds of the game. The Hitmen just let the clock run out. The cheering barely stopped during that time, and only increased when the game was officially over. Now we&#8217;re aiming for tickets for when they come back in the next round of playoffs (not sure if it&#8217;s semi-finals or finals).<br />
And now I&#8217;m back at work, but only to catch up on email. Soon, I&#8217;ll head home to finish of my weekend with the most exciting thing yet.<br />
Laundry.</p>

		<p>Tonight, I saw my first hockey game in about 20 years. When you&#8217;re able to count the last time you did something in decades, you know you&#8217;re getting old.<br />
The last time I saw a hockey game, I was about seven years old (I&#8217;m taking a guess at this, because I honestly don&#8217;t remember). It was between the Maple Leafs and the Chicago Blackhawks (as far as I can remember). I don&#8217;t remember who won, nor do I really remember the game. All I do remember is sitting on the east side of the rink, and remarking that unlike Maple Grove Arena, the seats weren&#8217;t freezing.<br />
Tonight, I saw Calgary&#8217;s WHL (Western Hockey League, for those of you who don&#8217;t recognize the acronym) team &#8212; the Hitmen &#8212; in a playoff game against the Regina Pats.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not since Kathryn returned to Toronto have I had some time off. I&#8217;ve been a busy little beaver, cutting down on the amount of work that&#8217;s been heaped on me in the past few weeks and months. So it goes without saying that one can get a little tired.<br />
I had planned to go in this weekend and try to work out more of the reports I&#8217;m working on. I came in early Saturday afternoon, and promptly accomplished nothing. Every word I typed, I erased. It was one of those days where nothing made sense, and every sentence only succeeded in detrimenting the entire report. A sure sign of exhaustion. So when Cory (my department head) suggested an evening out to relax, it seemed like a really good idea.<br />
Four of us from Web Development (Cory, Dennis, Shawn, and yours truly) along with one Designer (Neil, who regularly hangs out with Dennis and Shawn) found our way down to Chinook Bowling. Neil drove, which was a little odd, since it was almost impossible to see out Neil&#8217;s windows (they were a little foggy and dirty), and he wasn&#8217;t entirely sure of where the alley was. He kept saying that it was a bit of an &#8220;odd&#8221; door, but that he&#8217;d recognize it &#8212; a key thing because (according to Neil), there was no sign that said &#8220;bowling&#8221;.<br />
We found the door.<br />
Right under a large red sign that said &#8220;bowling&#8221;.<br />
We found, a bit to our chagrin, that we&#8217;d walked into a five-pin bowlerama, instead of the 10-pin, which I think we&#8217;d actually been hoping for. I don&#8217;t think we cared too much. Sure, some consider five-pin to be a retarded way to play &#8230; but they don&#8217;t play it the way we did.<br />
I should quickly detail the setting. Like most mall bowling alleys, it was in a basement. Built in the late 60s, it had received some more recent technology (computerized scoring, new lighting), but it was otherwise unchanged since it opened &#8230; including the shoes. (They are, I think, the worst shoes I&#8217;ve ever had to use. Which of course makes the experience all that much better.) The alley was packed with people, though I&#8217;m pretty sure we were among the oldest there. Certainly we were one of a small handful who had beer.<br />
Only moments after arriving, Cory&#8217;s name was called, indicating that a lane was now open. We hurried on with our shoes and headed directly for the awaiting lane. Our names were already entered into the computer system, appearing on the monitor above our lane. The five lonely pins glowed a purply tinge way off in the distance.<br />
Glowed? Oh yeah, missed that detail &#8212; it was glow in the dark bowling. Although the only thing that really glowed were the pins. The balls were they typical mottled black spheres. It&#8217;s probably a good thing they didn&#8217;t glow &#8212; if the staff had seen what we were doing with them, we&#8217;d have been kicked out before the end of the first game.<br />
I can actually remember the last time I went bowling &#8212; 5 December 1999 (see [[How to Throw a Surprise Party]]). My ex&#8217;s birthday. I had thrown her a surprise party (which had nearly given me an ulcer from the stress), and it had ultimately ended up in the Commodore Lanes. No glow bowl, though.<br />
I&#8217;ve noticed two things about my bowling ability. First, it seems to get better after a beer or two (although more than that has a severely inverse affect). Second, and this is the really bizarre one, I bowl better in the dark. I&#8217;ll never figure that one out&#8230;<br />
It took only a frame before Neil decided that our names weren&#8217;t right. So he took the liberty of changing them, usually when that particular person was up to roll. We went through many name changes, but I cannot really tell you what the final names we ended up with were. Not because I don&#8217;t remember (because I do), and not because they used objectionable words (otherwise we certainly would have been kicked out), but because the terms are &#8230; well &#8230; they carry certain meanings which I&#8217;d prefer not to have to explain.<br />
Not to mention that I don&#8217;t entirely understand them myself.<br />
My first game was off to a slow start (they usually do). But after a few throws, I began to remember how to throw a five-pin ball, and managed to sneak out in front by the time the round was over. The second game went completely to pot, and everyone but Cory and myself were trying new and unusual (and probably illegal in a few states) throws. For example, both Dennis and Shawn tried to throw the balls like you would in a baseball or softball game, though making sure that the ball didn&#8217;t bounce too hard. Dennis&#8217; most profound shot went directly into the gutter, but then ricocheted out, and managed to knock down the right two pins. For a couple of throws, Neil didn&#8217;t even get out of his chair, but opted to throw the ball from the bench. His accuracy wasn&#8217;t too bad, admittedly. I managed to win that round too, with a pitiful 165.<br />
Cory suggested that we attempt to get serious for our third game, but it&#8217;s hard to be serious when you have a hard time walking in a straight line. My game utterly fell apart, and was barely able to cross 100. I might have done better had we not run out of time on the game &#8230; and if the lights hadn&#8217;t come back on. Once I was able to see where I was throwing, my aim went totally off. Go figure. Cory won with a 188.<br />
Opting to leave the alley (being the only ones left, our rather unusual bowling styles were attracting a lot of attention), we headed over to Kensington for a post-game snack, and to discuss the future of our newly-formed bowling team &#8212; The Steamers (and no, I&#8217;m not telling you the full name). Neil, Dennis, and I made light of our short journey by singing Wayne Newton&#8217;s &#8220;Danke Schoen&#8221; at the top of our lungs, particularly when we managed to pull  up next to Cory&#8217;s truck. You can only imagine what it must have been like to have three mildly inebriated 20-somethings (barely) harmonizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I recall Central Park in fall,<br />
how you tore your dress,<br />
what a mess,<br />
I confess&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I paid for it the following morning, and most of day. But you&#8217;d be surprised how much a good bout of dim sum can take the edge off a hangover (albeit a mild one). Even then, though, I didn&#8217;t feel decent until around 6pm that night, when the Academy Awards hit the airwaves.<br />
Yeah, you&#8217;re probably wondering what I thought of them. (And even if you&#8217;re not, I&#8217;m telling you anyway.) This was a tough year for the Academy. Lots of really crappy movies means that only a handful are good enough to even consider, which means that the criteria between all the movies isn&#8217;t easy. Okay, so let&#8217;s look at the ones I had problems with (you can assume I agreed with the rest):<br />
Best Supporting Actor: Benicio Del Toro (Traffic)<br />
Okay, this isn&#8217;t so much a problem as I wanted Willem Dafoe to win for Shadow of the Vampire. Although the movie itself wasn&#8217;t worth nominating, his performance saved it from being a waste of celluloid. Were it up to me, I would have picked Dafoe.<br />
Best Actress: Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich)<br />
Yes, she&#8217;s attractive. Yes, she can act a million times better than her brother, Eric. But did she really deserve it? Well, there&#8217;s the $30 million dollar question (which is, ironically enough, probably what she&#8217;s gonna start asking for). Now, admittedly, I haven&#8217;t seen Erin Brockovich, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a good movie. (I&#8217;ve seen enough clips.) However, this is Julia Roberts we&#8217;re talking about. Both Chris and I have extreme reservations when it comes to her winning over performances such as Ellen Burstyn (Requiem For A Dream) who was utterly astounding, or even Bjork (Dancer In The Dark), who wasn&#8217;t even nominated for an Oscar! So why did Julia win? It was &#8220;her year&#8221;. She&#8217;s paid her dues, regardless of the talent of others. (Yeah, I sound a little bitter. I&#8217;m annoyed that the Academy still seems to work this way.)<br />
Best Actor: Russell Crowe (Gladiator)<br />
Okay, yes, he did an excellent performance, and he is a good actor. But I can&#8217;t help but wonder if it was all the lobbying that got him the award. I&#8217;ve heard amazing reviews of Ed Harris&#8217; performance in Pollock, which to me looks more worthy. Admittedly, I haven&#8217;t seen it, so this is mostly just me wondering about Hollywood. Not so much as with Best Picture, though.<br />
Best Director: Steven Soderbergh (Traffic)<br />
Steve&#8217;s a good director, I&#8217;ll give him that. And certainly with two nominations, he certainly upped his chances. But when you look at Traffic and compare it with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (I&#8217;m gonna abbreviate it to CTHD, &#8216;cuz it&#8217;s a lot to type), there isn&#8217;t much of a contest. The goal of a director is to provide the coordination and overall feeling for the movie. I&#8217;m sure Steve had a lot to do with that. But two things: 1) Traffic was based on a British series of the same name, so ol&#8217; Stevie had something existing to work with. 2) When it comes to having to manage sheer complexity, and being an utter nit-pick to get the scene just right, you can&#8217;t beat the tenacity that Ang Lee showed. (I know, because I read about it.) So yeah, I don&#8217;t agree with this one.<br />
Best Picture: Gladiator<br />
Wow. What a surprise. I think Chris and I both knew that Hollywood still wasn&#8217;t quite ready to choose a movie like CTHD as its best of the year. Disappointing in a way &#8212; CTHD embodied most of what movie-making has tried to create. That&#8217;s not to reduce Gladiator&#8217;s success even in the slightest &#8212; it, too, did an excellent job. But with both Life Is Beautiful and CTHD being nominated for Best Picture awards, maybe the future holds a more global view than the typical American fare.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Life is abdunant with difficult experiences. Some come from education, some from your job, some from a close relationship with a potential life partner. But there are few experiences that are as hard as saying goodbye to good friends.<br />
Critical Mass is opening an office in Toronto. Its first day of business is Monday the 19th. We&#8217;re staffing it with some people who were hired and brought here, and with some who were here and want to go back east. Tonight, Critical Mass said a fond farewell to 23 of its own, as they prepare to embark on a journey to the centre of the Universe (otherwise known as Toronto) and open our new office.<br />
It could have been more emotional, I suppose, but that&#8217;s probably why there was free alcohol, to keep us placated. (In retrospect, not a bad thing.) But it still didn&#8217;t dull the pain of seeing people leave. I know most of the people who are going, either by working with them or being on the same team.<br />
Today I said goodbye to three good friends: Dave, Mike, and Jen.<br />
Dave was the one who interviewed me when I first walked through Critical Mass&#8217; doors just over a year ago. I remember the interview well, thinking I was in a lot of trouble because I couldn&#8217;t figure out what he wanted. Dave&#8217;s got a good poker face. It wasn&#8217;t until we struck upon movies that he seemed to lighten up. Not a month later, I was seated a desk away from Dave, and since then have been fortunate to know Dave quite well. We spent several very long days and nights during the summer working on our respective projects, often staying until the wee hours of the morning alternating between coding and acting goofy.<br />
Mike was also in my department, but because he sat in a different area, I really didn&#8217;t get to know him until a couple of months after I got here. Mike&#8217;s wit and passion for independent films was what set him apart from most people, as did his fascination (some call it obsession) with strange video games like &#8220;Samba De Amigo&#8221;.<br />
I first met Jen on the night before we were to deliver a pitch for a potential client. She and Chris had been engaged in heavy conversation when I arrived. We found that she shared the same birthday as Chris and I, which created some sort of strange bond between the three of us. Jen and I have since seen a couple of Tuesday night movies (&#8220;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#8221; and &#8220;Chocolat&#8221;) and had a few deep conversations of our own. I&#8217;ve known Jen for only just over four months, but it feels like it&#8217;s been much longer.<br />
I&#8217;ve been preparing for this day for a long time, but it seems so surreal to have it finally arrive. Not an hour ago, I watched Dave and Mike drive away into the night, knowing that there would be no more game nights with them, no more breakfasts or lunches, no more movies. Soon, I will say goodbye to Jen, and she, too, will disappear into the night. No more deep conversations over pints of Guinness about movies or strange things that have happened in our lives.<br />
They&#8217;re still a part of Critical Mass, but they might as well have moved to the other side of the world for all it really matters. They&#8217;re not here.<br />
Last night, I went out with Dave for his second-to-last night in Calgary. I drank more than I would normally, probably to dull the pain. Tonight, I found myself doing the same again. Were I more sober, I would realise how much it hurts. I did my best to laugh and joke as Dave and Mike drove away, all the time feeling my insides twisting up into a single tight knot.<br />
Tomorrow, I will come to work, and see three empty desks where my friends used to sit. I&#8217;ll see their ghosts for days, maybe even weeks to come. Sure, there will always be email, but it&#8217;s never quite the same as being with them. This I know from experience.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say goodbye to good friends.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One year and one day ago, I did the hardest thing I&#8217;d ever done in my life: I said goodbye to Vancouver, to Radical Entertainment, and my friends. I then started a new life.<br />
Last year, I spent a month living in a city that I&#8217;d only been to three times before. I had two things in my favour: 1) I was living with family (my Aunt, Uncle, and cousin), and 2) I had time to myself to think, contemplate, and rebuild.<br />
It&#8217;s been 12 months since I arrived here. I look back at what I used to be, who I used to be, and I&#8217;m pleased that I bid farewell to that person &#8230; to that life. It was a dead-end for me, one of mental hardship and emotional strife. It&#8217;s something no-one should have to experience willingly.<br />
But I would be lying if I said I got here alone. Very few things can be done in life without help from others, and rarely does that help come without request. I had lots of help and support. From Joel, who helped me pack up my belongings; from Greg, who not only packed, but help me drive to Calgary; from my Aunt Brenda, Uncle Mike, and cousin Jen, who made me feel welcome in their home and provided me with the shelter I needed to restart; from all of my friends, near and far, who supported me in my decision; from my family, whose concern kept me going; and most of all from my sister Cathy, who became my pillar of strength in my hour of greatest need.<br />
Basically, if you&#8217;re reading this, you have contributed, even in some small way, to who I am. Even if all you did was send me an email joke, it was enough to brighten a day. To all of you, I say &#8220;Thanks&#8221;.<br />
I suppose I should go out and celebrate, rejoice in the freedom and happiness I enjoy. But it wouldn&#8217;t change much &#8212; I celebrate each and every moment, each and every friend and family member.<br />
May the years to come bring you as much happiness.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s amazing how old friends can make you feel young.<br />
A week and four days ago, Kathryn, one of our closest friends, came out to visit us (Chris, Stuart, Therese, and myself). The five of us all went to OTHS, and though we might have graduated different years, we&#8217;ve still been fast friends, and have kept contact over the years.<br />
Kathryn, like most of my closest friends, is an artist &#8230; specifically, the theatre arts. She&#8217;s a stage manager. Stage managers are responsible for making sure that a production goes off without a hitch. If it happens on, above, behind, below, in front, or off stage, it&#8217;s the Stage Manager who make sure it happens when it&#8217;s supposed to happen. It&#8217;s a hard job, and not everyone can do it. Kathryn lives for it.<br />
Unfortunately, it&#8217;s also not easy to get work &#8230; especially if you&#8217;re trying to break into the Toronto scene, which Kathryn is. She&#8217;s worked for years around Eastern Ontario, but getting work in Toronto is very difficult when you&#8217;re not there to get it. This is how Kathryn ended up with two months with nothing to do. This is also how Kathryn got the time to come out for a visit.<br />
Given, Alberta&#8217;s not the most inviting place in the middle of February &#8230; Mexico seems to be the popular destination this year for Albertans &#8230; but there are the few diehard skiers that make their way out here (despite the worst skiing conditions in years). And at least one person who came to see us, and what else was in our otherwise barren and snow-covered province.<br />
I took a few days off, partly because I needed to (you have no idea how bad I actually needed a vacation), and partly so I wouldn&#8217;t feel like we invited someone out only to ignore them. This, in retrospect, was probably the wisest thing I did. I had no idea how badly I actually needed to take a break. Yeah, I know, I went home for Christmas &#8230; but still, I needed the break.<br />
Kathryn came to Calgary on 15 February. I got up early that morning to finish cleaning up a bit: Vacuumed, cleaned the kitchen, wiped the floors, did a quick load of laundry, and bought a small vase of flowers for the night table (my room is a little spartan &#8212; I thought it could use a little colour and fragrance). I arrived at the airport about five minutes before Kathryn&#8217;s plane was to land. Figures that when I&#8217;m running a little late, so is Kathryn&#8217;s flight. She arrived about 45 minutes later, and was quite happy not only to be on terra firma, but in Calgary &#8212; she&#8217;d never been here before.<br />
Soon we arrived at our apartment, where I introduced Kathryn to her temporary home from home, and our roommate, Miao Yin. That was when I realized I&#8217;m either a really good listener, or psychic. Kathryn, who grew up with two cats, has sadly become allergic to them. As such, I had made sure that my bedroom (which was where Kathryn would sleep) was Miao Yin-free, not an easy task, let me tell you. &#8220;Curiosity killed the cat&#8221; isn&#8217;t just some quaint saying.<br />
Plopping on one of the couches, we talked for about three or so hours, when Chris finally came home. We ordered out for dinner that night, not wanting to get off to too fast a start &#8230; and not having a lot of food in the apartment worth cooking. Besides, Kathryn was dying to have Chinese served in one of those fancy paper boxes.<br />
When bedtime finally arrived, Kathryn retired to my room. She was a little dismayed at first that I was giving up my bed, but Chris and I will quite willingly offer our beds to our guests. So yes, I can safely say that I had a beautiful woman sleep in my bed for a week&#8230;<br />
&#8230;but I slept on the couch.<br />
(It&#8217;s not that bad. Our couches may be ugly as sin, but they&#8217;re quite comfy.)<br />
The next day, I Kathryn got a walking tour of downtown Calgary &#8230; from inside. The original plan had been to walk down 8th Ave to Theatre Calgary. However, the weather decided that it would disagree, and nearly froze us to death. We went into the +15 for comfort.<br />
The +15, for those of you who&#8217;ve never of it, is an above-ground series of walkways, not unlike Toronto&#8217;s underground PATH system. Same principle, same contents, just 30 feet in the opposite direction. A movie was made about it recently, called &#8220;Waydowntown&#8221;. Kathryn thought it was quite funny. I&#8217;ll have to see it sometime.<br />
We wound our way from the Husky building, through the parking garage (which is enclosed), through Penny Lane, and into the Eaton Centre, through the TD Centre, Home Oil Building, and ultimately into The Bay, where the trail ended. Then we braved the frigid outdoors to cross the street and duck into A&amp;B Sound. Kathryn wanted to see was the prices were like, and hey, it never hurts to go into a music store.<br />
Kathryn came out with nothing. I didn&#8217;t fare that lucky&#8230; (Enough with the snickering!) As we were trying to hunt down Great Big Sea&#8217;s &#8220;Play&#8221; album for Kathryn (hers had been snitched), she remembered some music I had to listen to: Afro-Celt Sound System. I&#8217;d never heard of them before, but I&#8217;m quite willing to take my friends&#8217; advice (especially those who share musical tastes) and go out on a limb. Both albums are great!<br />
Ducking out of A&amp;B Sound, we braved the cold for a couple of blocks until we got to Theatre Calgary. Calgary is a strange city. Most cities have theatre areas &#8230; Calgary has a theatre block. The whole block. A BIG block. There&#8217;s a concert hall, and six or seven theatres crammed into one space. Makes a night out easy to find, I&#8217;ll say&#8230;<br />
Kathryn is a theatre junkie, which makes sense, given her chosen profession. She wanted to see what else was playing, and if it was possible to see anything. Of the available plays, none really fell into a schedule that seemed to fit with anything. The only really interesting one was &#8220;The Vagina Monologues&#8221;, which is (from what I&#8217;ve heard) very good. Unfortunately, I could not find out if it was possible to get tickets in advance (all I got was a hard-to-understand answering machine).<br />
Leaving Theatre Calgary (toting a large number of pamphlets for theatre information), we walked the three blocks to Critical Mass. No, I was not going to work. I was taking Kathryn on a tour, after which we were going to meet up with Chris for lunch. It wasn&#8217;t an easy tour &#8212; I was trying not to be spotted and dragged into a discussion that, really, I couldn&#8217;t care less about.<br />
After distracting Chris from his work for about an hour and a half, Kathryn and I headed out for more exploration. Again, Calgary&#8217;s biting wind chased us indoors. This seemed like a good time to see how far we could walk in the +15. Although we had to go outside for a short while (the +15 has a few orphaned sections, due to the rapid pace of construction in downtown Calgary), we eventually found our way to the Sheraton Hotel, across the street from Eau Claire Market.<br />
Among many things, Kathryn was looking for gifts for friends of hers whose birthdays were fast approaching. While we found nothing for them, Kathryn was overjoyed to find a store that sold British chocolates. We also purchased four bottles of wine (not to be drunk all at one time).<br />
The walk back took us to within one block of our apartment, all indoors. After dumping our wares, we made a hasty visit to the Safeway to get groceries for dinner. I was going to attempt my first curry in months, and Kathryn was promising to make us chilli one night.<br />
We spent another (reasonably) quiet night in, watching TV and talking amongst ourselves. My curry was a bit of a disaster (although I was immensely happy that the rice turned out beautifully) &#8212; I&#8217;m out of practice. I need to make it a bit more frequently.<br />
Saturday was a bit of write-off as far as tourism goes. In preparation for Kathryn&#8217;s visit, I got my car tuned up and repaired &#8230; to the tune of almost $1,600. I won&#8217;t go into detail of what needed fixing, but suffice to say, it was stuff that I should have had looked at two years ago. (Unfortunately for me, at the time I had someone telling me that I was better off selling the car than getting it fixed.) It runs like a dream now &#8212; probably better than when I first got it. However, there had been one little problem &#8212; the brakes had given out a couple of days after I got the car back. I had the brakes fixed again (gratis, luckily), but I had been told to bring the car back for a double-check after I&#8217;d driven it a while. This was the first day I had the chance.<br />
So Kathryn put up with a 2-hour wait for the 10-minute inspection. I felt really bad, because she had flown 3,000 kilometres to wander around a mall and wait for something that I should&#8217;ve done before she arrived.<br />
During this time, we raided the nearby Costco for snack food and pop (Chris had invited people over for that evening). Normally, we drive to Costco. Anyone with an ounce of sense would drive to the Costco. Except me, of course. Figuring we had time to kill anyway, we went over to Costco and picked up two flats of pop and some frozen snacks. That was the easy part. The hard part was the walk back to the car. With two armfuls of pop and frozen food. Believe me, that stuff ain&#8217;t light. If we hadn&#8217;t stumbled across an abandoned shopping cart on our return trip, I don&#8217;t think my arms would&#8217;ve survived.<br />
The car not having yet moved, we retreated into the mall. This was fortunate on one account &#8212; the mall had a Payless Shoe store. And Kathryn needed a new pair of shoes. They had just what she was looking for.<br />
After wandering around for a short while, we stopped, had a drink &#8212; a mochaccino for Kathryn, and a hot chocolate for me &#8212; and shared some conversation. Kathryn and I talked a lot. About almost everything. But a lot of it, at least at first, was about how each of us were doing. Kathryn&#8217;s busy schedule only gives us brief glimpses into her life through sporadic email messages. And there are a lot of things that just don&#8217;t seem to make it into these logs &#8212; sometimes because it might make people feel uncomfortable, and sometimes because I just plain forgot.<br />
Finally deciding that the car should be ready (they hadn&#8217;t called me), we returned to the garage to pick it up. All was well, and we were on our way. Not long after getting back, our first guest arrived &#8212; Adrian, one of our co-workers at Critical Mass. Adrian brought a unique twist to our evening, a device that I had not actively played with since the early 80s.<br />
An Atari 2600.<br />
Okay, I should mention something before I get too far ahead of myself. Chris and I hold &#8220;game nights&#8221; on a pseudo-regular basis. We own a Dreamcast. No, not the most recent gaming system, but one that was relatively inexpensive, and has a lot of really good games available. (Not to mention that we found a good place to get games &#8230; uh &#8230; cheap, so our initial library was pretty decent.) We invite a group of people we know to be gamers, and we go nuts for upwards of six hours, beating each other into virtual pulps. Our neighbours must wonder what the hell goes on in our apartment. It&#8217;s a good thing we&#8217;ve got nice, thick, concrete walls.<br />
Anyway, back to the Atari. I hadn&#8217;t played one of these since I was a kid. But the old graphics, the sounds, and the action came back fast. The four of us got into the games very quickly. It was a lot of fun. I had originally been apprehensive that Kathryn would spend a third boring night in, made worse by watching a bunch of guys scream and yell over video games. For the record, Kathryn was utterly enthralled with the Atari &#8212; she remembered it well.<br />
Several people had arrived by the time Kathryn and I left. We were going to the Calgary Tower, Kathryn&#8217;s first real touristy activity. She wanted to see a sunset over the mountains, and this is about as good a place to see it as any. Not to mention, it&#8217;s a nice view of the entire city.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d been up Calgary Tower was in August of 1997, when Gerry and I blindly wandered around downtown Calgary trying to figure out what there was to see. I can still remember not knowing what we were looking at or where we were going. Today it all seems to simple&#8230;<br />
For those of you who have never experienced it, a sunset from Calgary Tower, especially on a clear day, it really quite something to behold. It attracts a bit of a crowd, too, for obvious reasons. We circled the tower a few times (which doesn&#8217;t take long &#8212; it&#8217;s not that big), and I pointed out some of the more significant landmarks. Kathryn sighed in excitement &#8212; she wanted to go to the mountains badly. That was a promise for Monday.<br />
About 10 minutes after sunset, we returned to street level, and headed back to the apartment. More people had arrived, and the Atari had been replaced with the Dreamcast &#8212; and tennis. Yeah, tennis. Not the most riveting of games &#8230; or so you&#8217;d think. In reality, this was probably one of the most popular games to hit it big in our game nights in quite a while. People were yelling and screaming, the trash talk flew, and as people got more practice, the games got more intense. Kathryn got complete into the insanity, and even started hamming it up with Dave (another co-worker), giving names to all the characters on screen. Even Stuart showed up for his first game night, and was immediately sucked into the mayhem.<br />
Things only got worse with Samba De Amigo. This is one of those really bizarre Japanese games that periodically make to North America. It&#8217;s a musical game &#8212; the graphics are almost irrelevant &#8212; that you play with &#8230; ready for this? &#8230; maracas.<br />
No, I&#8217;m not making this up.<br />
You plug in a pair of maracas. There are sensors that figure out where they&#8217;re being held, and there are accelerometers in the balls to detect when (and how hard) you shake them. This is basically the only game they&#8217;re used for, and to put it mildly, the game is just plain nuts. It was quite popular &#8230; after the initial shock wore off, anyway.<br />
Sunday morning was dim sum morning. This is a near-ritual for some of us, making our way down to Chinatown and bulking up on bite-size morsels of Oriental goodness. We met up with Stuart, Therese, and Janine, and couldn&#8217;t wait to get to a table and start the feast.<br />
After dim sum, Janine took off with friends, leaving the five of us to our post-dim sum ritual &#8230; shopping. Normally we go to the mall downtown, but periodically, we venture down to Chinook Centre, the best mall in town. We toured in and out of a few stores, looking at interesting things, but not really biting at the offered wares. The only real purchases came at Black&#8217;s Camera, where Therese and Kathryn took the opportunity to stock up on film.<br />
We headed back downtown, in search of activities to keep us occupied for the remainder of the afternoon. Kathryn suggested we stop in at the Glenbow Museum, and see what there was to see. That was when we found out about the Glenbow&#8217;s peculiar sales habits &#8212; they sell only a limited number of tickets for the day. When we got there, they were sold out. As you can imagine, that had us quite confused &#8212; it&#8217;s a museum, not a concert! But the Glenbow limits the tickets so all their visitors will receive an enjoyable experience, rather than packing the place full.<br />
We ended up retreating to our apartment, to strike up a brief game of tennis. Therese and Stuart stuck around that evening, and the five of us spent a lazy Sunday night having dinner, talking, and watching the Sunday night line-up.<br />
Monday was Family Day in Alberta, an odd statutory holiday cooked up (assumedly) for the auspices of getting more skiing in during the winter. In any case, Chris and I both had the day off (Stuart&#8217;s company defers the day to later in the year, and Therese just needed to get work done without anyone bugging her) and so took Kathryn into the Canadian Rockies.<br />
The morning was grey &#8230; well, actually white. It wasn&#8217;t snowing, but the sky looked like someone had accidentally bleached the blue out. I was a bit apprehensive about going &#8212; I really wanted Kathryn to experience Banff on a nice day &#8212; but she insisted that it was worth the risk. I guess after stalling for four days, she was ready to go, no matter what the weather was like.<br />
After a quick run to my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s to borrow their park pass, we headed towards the mountains. Normally, you can see the mountains as soon as you clear Calgary city limits (which happen to be at the top of a hill which blocks the view of the mountains), but the weather was so bleak that we couldn&#8217;t see anything until we were within 20 kilometres.<br />
Luckily for us, the weather started clear within a few minutes of arriving in Banff, just as the Weather Channel had predicted. By the time we climbed out of the car, blue sky was clearly visible. An hour later, we had to wear sunglasses as not to be blinded.<br />
Our first stop was at the Cave and Basin (yeah, I know it&#8217;s becoming a habit). Unlike previous tours, we didn&#8217;t actually go into the cave, but walked around on the outside. Then it was over to the new(er) hot springs on the east side of Sulphur Mountain. Kathryn was utter giddy with delight from all the vistas that she could see. Then it was down to the Bow Falls below the Banff Springs Hotel, and then to the hotel itself.<br />
The hotel&#8217;s changed since I was last there with Cathy and Craig. Back then, you entered the hotel through the &#8220;rear&#8221; of the hotel. At the time, the hotel was adding a new entrance on the &#8220;front&#8221;. That construction is now complete, and you can no longer enter the old way. The new entrance is much more impressive, though.<br />
In what looks like an effort to spruce up the appearance of the hotel, CP Hotels is changing the ethos of the old place, and making it into a castle. The new entrance is a Great Hall, complete with grey stone work, long corridors with austere appearances, and new staircases and wall faces that resemble something out of a dark ages keep. Unfortunately, it also meant that all the restaurants were closed for the renovation &#8230; lunch was out that day.<br />
We stopped again just on the north side of the Banff Street bridge, so Kathryn could get a good picture looking through the downtown, towards Cascade Mountain (which she absolutely fell in love with). This was our base for wandering around town for the next hour or so. We wandered up Banff Street to the Visitor&#8217;s Information Centre (which I had last visited some three and a half years ago with Gerry), then across the street for a quick drink at a nearby Second Cup, then by the fudge shop, and finally back to the car.<br />
Then it was off to Lake Louise. It had been an off-the-cuff suggestion, and everyone seemed game. We got there about 30 minutes before sunset (sunset at Lake Louise, that is &#8212; the sun wouldn&#8217;t set for another hour or so), so had ample light to look around.<br />
This was the first time I&#8217;d seen the lake totally frozen. I had been there in late May once, and the lake had still been ice-covered, but this was so well frozen that people could hike all over its surface. Which is precisely what we ended up doing&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s quite an experience to hike to the middle of Lake Louise. You&#8217;re about a kilometre from anything. Mountains on three sides, and a itty-bitty little hotel on the fourth. (In the middle of the lake, the hotel is quite small.) Aside from a few other people, you&#8217;re alone. It&#8217;s quiet &#8212; no cars, no planes, nothing there to take away from the beauty of the land. The soft, white snow extends smoothly until it reaches the mountains, then gives way to an upthrust of white, beige, brown, red, and black. The sun casts stark shadows in the jagged rock, and it seems so odd because there&#8217;s absolutely no noise.<br />
Chris has recently started a search for his spirituality. It&#8217;s given the two of us many an occasion for deeply philosophical conversations. Kathryn had played devil&#8217;s advocate with Chris a couple nights earlier, not questioning why Chris was searching, but wanting to know his reasons. (The only real way to see someone&#8217;s thought processes is to ask them hard questions.) Kathryn had posed Chris a question: &#8220;What does God give you?&#8221; Chris has answered it adequately at the time. As the three of us stood in the middle of the lake, staring at sights that few people in the world could even imagine, he quietly said: &#8220;This is what God gives me.&#8221; There was no rebuttal.<br />
We walked about 9/10ths the length of the lake before turning back. The walk up wasn&#8217;t an easy one &#8212; the uneven path was hard-packed snow, barely a foot and a half wide by the time we turned around. We were regularly slipping off into the powdery surrounding snow. Chris trudged through the powder uneventfully, his boots and long underwear protecting him from the cold. The walk back was considerably easier, as the west side of the lake had a fairly wide area of packed snow.<br />
After a quick stop in the hotel to use the facilities, we hit the road for our trip back to Calgary. The sun set as we drove, and by the time we reached the city limits, it was dark. A little too dark. It looked like my headlights weren&#8217;t working. A quick stop at a gas station revealed that while light was being emitted by my headlights, all the dirt and salt from our day&#8217;s excursion had made the glass almost completely opaque. A quick wipe with a wet squeegee fixed that.<br />
The following day was cool and bright &#8212; the perfect day for spending a few hours buried in a museum. This time, Kathryn and I got tickets, and spent the day in glorious education at the Glenbow Museum. Kathryn, like myself, is a reader. Whereas Cathy and Craig might be able to blitz through the Royal Tyrell Museum in 30 minutes, Kathryn and I spent three and a half hours reading nearly every word on Asian art and sculpture (mostly revolving around Hindu and Buddhist artefacts) and on the Egyptian culture (courtesy of a travelling exhibit). We only managed to get through one floor before we had to stop. Our brains hurt from the information overload.<br />
On our way home, we stopped into a Second Cup for refreshments, and what ended up being a nice long conversation. It started out with me apologizing for being such a dullard. You&#8217;re probably wondering why I did that? Well, it&#8217;s not easy to explain. Chris and Kathryn have a much more animated conversational style, certainly one that looks more interesting and exciting than the one she has with me. With Chris, they laugh, exchange mock insults, and carry on in a more exuberant manner. With me, things are more &#8230; well, dull. I felt bad about that. I honestly felt like Kathryn was bored out of her mind being around me so much, because I&#8217;m such a dull person. (And yes, I have to admit that I&#8217;m dull. And if you disagree with me, I&#8217;ll point you to my dating history.)<br />
Kathryn was quick to object. (She is a good friend, after all.) She brought up an interesting point that I hadn&#8217;t really considered before. (Which is ironic, considering her point was something I&#8217;d noted many times since high school.) Kathryn is artistic &#8212; she sings, she acts, she works in theatre. Chris is artistic &#8212; he sings, he creates imagery, he&#8217;s an excellent photographer. I&#8217;m not artistic &#8212; I can&#8217;t sing to save my life, can&#8217;t even draw a good-looking stick person, can&#8217;t act my way out of a paper bag. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a geek. I&#8217;ve always been a geek &#8212; even when I was a little kid, I was a geek. I wanted to know how everything worked (which is why I went through a few portable cassette players before I figured that taking another apart didn&#8217;t serve any purpose).<br />
Kathryn called me &#8220;philosophical&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a general thing, or if that&#8217;s just because of the conversations I&#8217;d been having with her to that point (she&#8217;d asked me if I were a different person, and I&#8217;d ended up waxing poetic for about a half hour on my personal development over the past year). I suppose in a way I am philosophical &#8230; but I gotta tell ask, what woman would find that interesting? Again, I point you to my dating history&#8230;<br />
That evening, Kathryn and I make use of cheap Tuesday, and caught a showing of &#8220;O Brother, Where Are Thou?&#8221;, the Coen Brothers&#8217; latest cinematic outing. We thoroughly enjoyed the movie &#8212; it&#8217;s a great mythic romp through 1930&#8217;s southern United States. We didn&#8217;t find it nearly as funny as a guy a row or two back from us. Everyone&#8217;s seen or heard of the stereotypically loud-mouthed moron who finds something as trivial as a guy sneezing the funniest thing ever put on film. Well, that night we met one. I&#8217;m reasonably certain we weren&#8217;t the only ones in the theatre who wanted to gag and bind him for the duration of the movie. I feel sorry for the friends who go with him &#8230; assuming he has any.<br />
Wednesday was another educational trek through Alberta, this time to Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, about two hours south of Calgary. This is a location where, until 120 years (but starting over 5,500 years ago), Native tribes would drive herds of buffalo off a cliff. Head-Smashed-In is one of the best preserved, and due to the outstanding Interpretation Centre built nearby, has earned a place as a UNESCO site.<br />
It was Kathryn&#8217;s first visit to the Prairies. The drive down afforded her a constantly changing contrast of rolling hills, flat plains, and distant mountain vistas. (Not to mention a few oil well pumps.) Kathryn was so happy to be engaging in touristy activities that I sometimes wondered if I really needed to be there. (I&#8217;ve seen most of this stuff before, so I was only there as a pseudo tour guide.)<br />
We arrived at the Buffalo Jump just before noon. The first stop in the tour is along the ridge where buffalo used to plunge to their deaths. (Buffalo have very poor eyesight, and the Native tribes were able to exploit this deficiency under the right conditions.) It&#8217;s to introduce you to the site before you learn about it. Up there, you can&#8217;t hear a thing. It&#8217;s dead silent. Oppressively silent. It&#8217;s almost deafening. For city folk, it can be a bit unnerving. I find it hugely relaxing. We had a few moments of silence before we were bombarded by a small group of Native kids, who were assumedly on an excursion to learn about their heritage.<br />
We spent about three and a half hours at Head-Smashed-In, learning (and in my case, relearning) the history of the site, and the way of the peoples who use the site. I was glad I&#8217;d come &#8212; my knowledge had managed to distort a little since my last visit.<br />
We left for home around 3:30 in the afternoon. We made a brief stop in Fort MacLeod, about 5 minutes further south on Highway 2 so Kathryn could get a bite to eat. I was beginning to come down with a cold, and my appetite had vanished. But soon we were on our way back home.<br />
That night, Chris, Kathryn, and I went to Stuart and Therese&#8217;s apartment for dinner. It was like old times &#8212; really old times. We&#8217;ve all known each other for 10 years. We&#8217;d all gotten together at Christmas, but this was a little different. We were in a homey environment, without having to yell above the teeming masses. It was one of those times when you know that no matter what may come, we&#8217;ll still be friends when we&#8217;re all retired and living on some sandy shore in a non-extradition country with a low tax rate.<br />
My vacation ended Thursday morning, and it was time for me to go back to work. Kathryn left for Edmonton later that morning to visit with friends. This was a good thing &#8212; my suspected cold was turning into a nasty cold. I drugged myself up heavily and trudged into work to see what I could get done &#8230; and wade through the 100+ email I&#8217;d managed to accumulate in that time.<br />
The only productive thing I got done that day was finally launch Critical Mass&#8217;s new website (http://www.criticalmass.com/). This is what has been sucking up huge amounts of my time since early December. If it hadn&#8217;t been the wait to get client approval on some stuff, we&#8217;d have had it up a long time ago. But our website isn&#8217;t high on our clients&#8217; priorities.<br />
I like this site, and not just because I was the lead developer. I like it because we let the Design department try some interesting ideas that we&#8217;d never tried before. The result is a lot of DHTML animation that had me staring at the ceiling for a few collective days, trying to figure out ways of getting it to work. (Sounds kinda dumb, I know, but when you have to deal with several different browsers across two platforms, it&#8217;s more work than you think.)<br />
The launch complete, I bailed for home as my cold decided to take me down. I called in sick on Friday, the cold having taken me down completely. (I could have gone in, but I figured I&#8217;d get just as much work done at the office as I would sleeping at home.)<br />
Kathryn and her housemate Mareca (I hope that&#8217;s the correct spelling) returned to Calgary Saturday afternoon. Kathryn and Mareca have been friends for quite a while, so I understand, and are both in the theatre biz. Mareca&#8217;s a little older than Kathryn (having just turned 30 &#8212; though she&#8217;s far too cute to be 30, in my humble opinion), but has the energy of someone 10 years younger.<br />
Kathryn, Mareca, Mareca&#8217;s friend Karen, and I were going to a play that night. Mareca had a friend in the production who got us half-price tickets, and it seemed like fun. Besides, I&#8217;d never seen Camelot before. The show was quite good, though being a theatre novice (I&#8217;ve only seen a few productions), I was happier with the performance than the other three. They pulled it apart. But not half as bad as Bryce, who played Mordred.<br />
Bryce is an old friend of Mareca, and is an accomplished actor. He&#8217;s also got a great singing voice (I still have &#8220;Fie On Goodness&#8221; reverberating around in my head) and a great sense of humour. I got to know him a little, as he came back with us to the apartment, where I exchanged my place in the group with Chris so they could go out to a &#8220;party&#8221; to dance the night away. While the idea was appealing, my cold was winding down, and spending several hours in a smoky environment was a good way to drag that cold out for days.<br />
We took Kathryn and Mareca out for dim sum on their last day in Calgary. Bryce and Karen also attended, as did Stuart and Therese. (Stuart and Therese ended up leaving early, due to Stuart&#8217;s ankle, which he sprained earlier in the day.) After our Oriental repast, we gathered Kathryn and Mareca&#8217;s bags and took them to the airport.<br />
Which was strangely packed. Air Canada&#8217;s history of long line-ups (they said they were busy, which was true, but only because half their desks were closed) came back again. Luckily, instead of the hour wait, Kathryn and Mareca were able to use the Express check-in, and were ready in about 20 minutes. For a delayed flight. The five of us grabbed a table in Tim Horton&#8217;s (a truly Canadian tradition) and wasted time. (Of course, you never really waste time with friends.)<br />
When the time came for them to board, we walked them over to the gate and bid them a safe journey. It was strange &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t really sad to see them go. Probably because I knew I&#8217;d see them (or at least Kathryn) again. But when they did finally leave, I could help but notice how empty things suddenly seemed.<br />
We dropped Bryce off at Theatre Calgary so he could get his bike, and then Chris and I returned home. Things didn&#8217;t look any different, but still something seemed missing. Kathryn had been here for over a week &#8212; it was the longest I&#8217;d seen her since &#8230; well, since ever, really.<br />
So on Sunday night, I finally crawled back into my own bed to get a good night&#8217;s sleep. But I couldn&#8217;t. I tossed and turned, feeling a little empty. It could have been that a close friend was gone, and I didn&#8217;t know when I would see her again. It could have been the foreign feeling of being back in my own room. It could have been that I hadn&#8217;t slept in my bed for 10 days.<br />
I should have slept on the couch.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Wednesday, I came home to something different. Chris and I have a new roommate.<br />
Now I knew about this, so it wasn&#8217;t surprise. Nevertheless, it is taking a bit getting used to. She&#8217;s fairly short, a little overweight, a quite aloof. But she&#8217;s quiet, so we all get along. I suppose the only drawback is her tendency to shed.<br />
Oh, did I forget to mention that our new roommate is a cat?<br />
Yes, we have a cat. Her name is Miao-Yin. For those of you who don&#8217;t get the reference immediately, don&#8217;t worry about it. If I were to tell you, you&#8217;d probably say &#8220;Figures&#8230;&#8221;. For those of you who *do* know the reference &#8230; well, you&#8217;ve probably already said &#8220;Figures&#8230;&#8221;<br />
For the record, incidentally, Miao-Yin isn&#8217;t my cat &#8212; she&#8217;s Chris&#8217;. Those of you who know Chris have probably now done the double take I did when he asked to bring in a cat. I was surprised to say the least &#8212; I never pegged Chris as a cat person. Maybe a boa constrictor person, but not a cat person.<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;m quite happy about having a cat. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve lived with one. (When you&#8217;ve grown up with cats, you really miss them when you don&#8217;t have them.) Miao-Yin&#8217;s fairly old &#8212; 8 years, so her idea of entertainment is watching Chris trying to entertain her. Actually, I can see the humour in that myself. He tries hard, I&#8217;ll give him that, but getting an older cat to do anything is about as useful as flashlight in the middle of the midday desert. He&#8217;ll learn eventually.<br />
Miao-Yin is a black and white domestic shorthair (which means, of course, that she sheds about a pound of fur a day &#8212; Chris has taken to vigorously brushing her every day). In many ways, she resembles my first cat, Sylvester, who died in 1993. I didn&#8217;t really realize how much I missed Sylvester until Miao-Yin moved in. She&#8217;s definitely not the same cat (Miao-Yin is MUCH more laid back than Sylvester was at 8 years of age), but the memories still come back. I suppose this will be good therapy for loss never truly accepted.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s good therapy in general. It&#8217;s been proven (though for the life of me, I can&#8217;t remember by whom or where that study is) that even just staring at a sleeping cat reduces stress. Miao-Yin sleeps a lot. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been this relaxed in a long time&#8230;<br />
There is only one itty bitty problem with having a cat. It&#8217;s a no-no in our lease. Dunno what the punishment is, but if it&#8217;s like people I knew back in Vancouver, we could face eviction. But I&#8217;m not too worried &#8212; Miao-Yin&#8217;s pretty quiet, doesn&#8217;t smell, and doesn&#8217;t try to run out the door when we open it. Chris&#8217; argument is that the building is supposed to be smoke-free, yet we smell cigarette (and marijuana) smoke all the time. Dunno if that argument would fly, but should it ever come about, we&#8217;ll give it a whirl. Frankly, I don&#8217;t see the problem with cat anyway &#8212; she&#8217;s litter trained, and doesn&#8217;t even claw the furniture (which would probably make it look better, admittedly).<br />
I suppose it could be worse, though &#8212; Chris could have adopted a pot-belly pig.</p>
