		<p>That stupid rooster woke us up again. We&#8217;ve taken to mocking it. If it crowed normally, we probably wouldn&#8217;t mind so much. I fell back asleep, though, and Alex went into the house. She came back to wake me up for breakfast.<br />
Fog was hugging the ground all down the river valley. (Not exactly unheard of in the Lower Mainland.) Naturally, this set me off on a photography expedition. You have to move quickly with fog &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t last long once the sun starts coming up. I got some wonderful pictures, especially of a space amongst the trees near the tent.<br />

		<p>There&#8217;s a rooster not far from Allen&#8217;s farm. (Well, &#8220;farm&#8221; is using the term a bit loosely. It was a farm before he bought it, and it will be one again. But it&#8217;s going to take a bit of work.) This rooster isn&#8217;t particularly normal. We&#8217;ve been speculating why it doesn&#8217;t sound normal. Most roosters gain their sound by listening and mimicing the sound of other roosters. This rooster doesn&#8217;t seem to have rooster peers, so it lacks the stereotypical cockle-doodle-doo one would expect at 5:30 in the morning.<br />
This one sounds like a cross between a coyote and a freight locomotive horn.<br />

		<p>Cory had called me yesterday. I didn&#8217;t know until this morning because I hadn&#8217;t checked my cell phone. I&#8217;d had a dream that things had gone horribly awry at the office, and for some reason, that had made me want to check my cell phone. Good or bad, something was up. Sure enough, our newest star hire had backed out &#8212; an extremely disappointing turn of events. I wouldn&#8217;t talk to Cory about it until late in the afternoon.<br />
We were gone before 8:00. (We were to have left at 6:00, then 7:00, but last night&#8217;s arrival in Fairmont pushed us even later.) Allen was in Jean&#8217;s Honda Civic, Alex and I in Alex&#8217;s car. I drove while Alex read &#8220;Why I Hate Canadians&#8221;. Today&#8217;s lesson? Canada&#8217;s cast system, more formally known as how poorly we treat Indians. It&#8217;s a hard thing for a Canadian to admit that we don&#8217;t treat everyone fairly and equally. For a country known as being &#8220;nice&#8221;, we treat our aboriginal peoples very poorly. We&#8217;ve marginalized, forcibly contained, abducted and tried to convert them, even poisoned them with disease. And yet after 400 years, they&#8217;re still who they are.<br />

		<p>No-one told me that we were doing any surprises this weekend. &#8216;Course, then it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise, would it?<br />
Allen (Alex&#8217;s father) took Jean (Alex&#8217;s stepmom) down to Cranbrook so she could catch a flight out to southern Ontario for a wedding. This meant the condo was quiet for a number of hours. That meant we didn&#8217;t get up until late. I love sleeping in.<br />

		<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like waking up to the sound of lawnmowers. Rousing, yet entirely annoying.<br />
We started the day off with a mom saver. This is generally a breakfast meal, though I suppose you could just as easily use a version of one for any meal of the day. The breakfast one we had consists of eggs, cubed bread, cream cheese (cubed, or something similar), some spices, and thrown in the oven to cook for 45 minutes. Throw on some maple syrup on top, and it&#8217;s pretty tasty. There&#8217;s also a ham and cheese version that I&#8217;m dying to try some time.<br />

		<p>I so wanted to get my butt out of the office, almost from the moment that I was alerted to the problem on MBUSA.com&#8217;s live server. There&#8217;s nothing like trying to diagnose the cause of a homepage failure when you&#8217;re not really sure what happened.<br />
Most of my day was like this. Going from one hot spot to another, barely getting enough time to wolf down some lunch. By the end of the day, I had to make sure that I wrapped up dialogue on three separate projects, ensure that the process was moving on two more, finish a proposal to Danny Sullivan for presentation topics for the next Search Engine Strategies conference, and write a rather lengthy email to about a dozen people to make sure they have some inkling about what the heck I&#8217;ve been doing for the last couple of weeks.<br />
Care to take bets that things will still go to hell in a handbasket tomorrow?<br />

		<p>It&#8217;s been a while since our last surprise weekend (see [[Surprise Visit to Drumheller]]), but not for a lack of wanting. We&#8217;ve been that busy. Either Alex has had to work (the joys of working in the medical community) or we&#8217;ve both been traveling. This weekend was the first one we&#8217;d had to get away.<br />
It was a bit of a special one, but for no other reason than we&#8217;d barely seen each other in almost three weeks. I was away in San Jose for a conference (see [[Search Engine Strategies Conference 2004 San Jose, Calgary to San Jose]]), followed immediately by the Calgary Dragon Boat Festival (see [[2004 Calgary Dragon Boat Festival]]), and then Alex was off in Ontario for a week and a half. So I had to plan this weekend&#8217;s getaway so we&#8217;d have some time to ourselves.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, My Favourite Giant left Critical Mass. And we are lessened by his departure.<br />
Luke Puxley started at Critical Mass not quite two years ago. He was a daunting figure, mostly due to his sheer size. Luke is not a small man, though he never played the &#8220;big man&#8221; role. He was simply a larger version of EveryMan. He was kind, funny, helpful, thoughtful, intelligent, and hard-working.<br />
And he liked to goof off just as much as the rest of us. Maybe moreso.<br />
Luke was &#8220;My Favourite Giant&#8221; to some of us, &#8220;The Giant&#8221; to others, &#8220;Sir Bonks-A-Lot&#8221; to a precious few, but was as much a Critical Masser as the rest of us. He will be forever immortalized in a sketch prepared for our summer Town Hall (see [[Critical Mass Summer Town Hall and Kananaskis Cowpunch]]), most notably for his portrayal of a hard-working, sweat, big guy. (Come to think of it, some of us are still haunted by those images&#8230;)<br />
So it was simply natural that we have to make a final burst for Luke as he heads his way to an MBA. Yesterday, Mark arranged for a lunch at the Drum and Monkey, which I couldn&#8217;t attend due to an interview I had to conduct. (For the record, I don&#8217;t much like the Drum and Monkey for lunch, anyway. Too much food, and the service is lousy.) We would make a go of the usual run of things: Vicious Circle and sushi afterwards.<br />
Late because of a long-running conference call, I arrived at VC shortly after 17:40. Festivities were already well underway. Although we didn&#8217;t have a massive gathering, there were at least 25 people in attendance. Not shabby for someone who&#8217;d been mired on the Mercedes account for three-quarters of his employ.<br />
Friday afternoon was sunny and warm, and sitting on the patio of VC was something we all could enjoy. It wasn&#8217;t long before the Critical Mass team dominated the east side of the patio. We could have packed in more people, but were snubbed by Steve and Jana, and later by Thelton and Christie (though they had a better excuse &#8212; anniversaries do tend to take precendence).<br />
As afternoon turned into early evening, attendees started to drop off. The call for sushi went out, but acquired only a handful of takers: Scott, Linday, Luke, Reid, and yours truly. When minimal mass (the opposite of critical mass &#8212; when a sufficiently small number requires the dissolution of a particular state) was finally attained, the five of us headed over to the Sumo Lounge in Eau Claire Market (convenient for Luke, Lindsay, and myself, since we all live within walking distance).<br />
We had a booth to ourselves, thankfully away from everyone else. Why thankfully? Because we were loud.<br />
Okay, <em>I</em> was loud.<br />
One litre of sake between the five of us. Luke eventually cut himself off (it was a bit much for him). Peter Kinjo, the owner and Chief Troublemaker, made a point to come around and spread his unique brand of cheer. No dancing for Luke in a rubber wig and kimono, though &#8212; I suspect they wouldn&#8217;t have fit him, anyway.<br />
Departing Sumo, all of us but Reid (he was heading out to join up with Jim) headed upstairs to the Cineplex to play some air hockey. Luke went down in the first round, but it wasn&#8217;t an easy one. (Sake really destroys hand-eye coordination.) He&#8217;d get his revenge later on. We went around to various video games before deciding to give pool a shot. Somehow, we ended up playing darts instead. That took a while, since none of the four of us were any good.<br />
Oh, and that round of bottle caps (drinks, not the candy) didn&#8217;t really help, either.<br />
Scott and I finished a round of pool while waiting for Luke and Linday to finish their darts game. Despite having a near total lack of coordination at this point, I was able to aim surprisingly well. The lack of coordination finally showed through when Luke took me down in a final game of air hockey.<br />
With that, we all headed out into the unusually warm Calgary evening, Luke and Linday heading up to Crescent Heights, Scott and I heading over to my place in Sunnyside. I offered to give Scott a ride home, but needed to sit down a while and rest before getting behind a wheel. (Just because I&#8217;m inebriated doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m irresponsible.)<br />
We watched The Simpsons on DVD before I was inspired to put on The Great Escape. I fell asleep barely into the movie (I was exhausted), waking up about an hour or so in. By this point, it was almost 3:00. I took Scott home, hitting the sack almost as soon as I got back.<br />
The office will certainly be a quieter place without Luke around anymore. But we&#8217;re sure we&#8217;re going to see him from time to time.<br />
After all, he&#8217;s gonna miss us at the breakfast table.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend, we went for a little paddle. Five hundred metres in about two minutes and five seconds, to be precise.<br />
This weekend was the 13th annual Calgary Dragon Boat Festival, or the Alberta Dragon Boat Racing Festival, depending on who you ask. It&#8217;s the largest in Alberta and attracts teams from as far away as Edmonton and Lethbridge (or so I gather). Most teams seem to be local.<br />
The races take place on the Glenmore Reservoir, the only body of water in Calgary large enough to handle something like this. It&#8217;s big enough for a 500 metre course, with more than enough room to spare for the various sail boats and Heritage Park&#8217;s paddle wheeler, without causing trouble.<br />
Alex and I arrived (still very sleepy) at 7:00 Saturday morning, to try and find the Topmade tent. Easier said than done, since there is almost no decoration at that hour of the morning of the first day. Fortunately, the club had been busy, already having hung the banner and brought in the trailer with the equipment (specifically, paddles and life jackets). There were three tables, some with food, and a huge pile of water bottles (over 2,000 at last estimate) to help us out.<br />
The tents were set up in a block &#8220;U&#8221; shape, with Topmade in the southeast corner. Each tent was about 10 feet by 10 feet square, with a high pointy roof. Some tents were subdivided to handle the size of the teams. Some had only half a tent. There were even rumours of quartered tents.<br />
Topmade had three entire tents.<br />
There are eight teams in Topmade: Dragoneers (the competitive team), Dynasty (the semi-competitive team), DI-Hard Dragons (where I started, a recreational team), Water Dragons (another rec team), Spirit Dragons (rec), Trico Select Dragons (rec), Red Dragons, (men&#8217;s team), and Phoenix (women&#8217;s team). The latter two (men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s) aren&#8217;t dedicated teams, and are comprised of members from the other teams.<br />
By 8:00, we were all assembled and DI-Hard started its warm-up. That was a bit difficult, as the weather outside was not exactly cooperative. It was cold and raining. None of us were particularly happy about that. Warm-up not really having lived up to its name (but our muscles sufficiently loosened), we were called down to the marshalling area to prepare for our first race.<br />
The festival was set up with the tents quite a ways from the docks. Why, I don&#8217;t know. It meant all the teams had to go up and down a set of stairs that was simply not big enough for all the traffic. The marshalling area was at the Calgary Canoe Club&#8217;s docks (which is where we sailed from). In between the tents and the stairs was the stage and beer tent, ideally set up to prevent the easy flow of competitors from their tents to the boats. (Seeing a theme of planning here?)<br />
We arrived at the marshalling area, shivering in the cold, and told to wait in the rain while the opening ceremonies took place. We didn&#8217;t get to really see or hear them (we were just far enough way to miss it), nor did we really care at that moment &#8212; all we knew was that we were cold and wet, and it wasn&#8217;t even 9:00 yet.<br />
Finally, the first batch of racers went out and the festival got underway. We took our place under the marshalling canopy until it was our turn to go out. There were 12 dragon boats, used in rotations of six &#8212; half out on the race, the other half loading for the next one. Ideally, not a problem. However, the weather conspired against us, and it was exceedingly difficult to stage the boats without them drifting in the wind. So the process was a little slow.<br />
When our boat was called, we marched down to the docks and lined ourselves up for our boat. We were up against one of our own in the first race &#8212; Water Dragons (I think), which Arnold (our coach and drummer) also drummed for. For what reason, we&#8217;re not sure, but Arnold left us for the other boat, bringing in Christine from Dynasty to drum in his place. Thankfully, Topmade&#8217;s drummers are all top-notch.<br />
Here&#8217;s the trick to dragon boating: Focus. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all there is. Don&#8217;t listen to anything but your drummer and your steerer. I mean any *thing*. Not the birds, the wind, the PA systems, the crowd, you name it. All you should hear are instructions. That&#8217;s how you get through a race without killing yourself (or the rest of your team) wondering how other teams are doing, etc.<br />
Christine took us down to the staging area, which is two buoys (about 20 metres) behind the start line. It took a while to get the boats sorted out, but we finally got ourselves lined up. Then the six boats slowly started forward. These were rolling starts, meaning you didn&#8217;t totally stop before &#8220;Go!&#8221; was called.<br />
Normally, in race conditions, I get severe nerves. When I was on the swim team back in high school, I used to get so nervous my bladder would shrink to the size of a pea (yes, pun intended) right before a race. That&#8217;s what focus gives you &#8212; no nervousness. You pay attention to the drummer and steerer. You focus on their words, and you can actually forget what else is going on around. It&#8217;s very zen.<br />
From the moment the first start was called until we heard &#8220;let it ride!&#8221;, I can&#8217;t really tell you what happened. We weren&#8217;t perfect, we weren&#8217;t ideal. But we won the race, one of two heats we&#8217;d run on Saturday. (A bit of a misnomer, since the festival organizers later discounted all the first heats for some unknown reason.) Our time? About 2:21.<br />
Bonnie (our steerer) just about broke down when we got back to the docks. The wind and water currents had given her an extremely hard time. Added to the stress of the first race, she wasn&#8217;t exactly in the best of conditions, and understandably so. She, like most of the rest of us, would pile into sleeping bags and blankets to try and warm up when we got back to the tents.<br />
So began the day of keeping an ear out for which team was being marshalled, having to run back to the tents for equipment, running back and forth from the portable toilets, and generally trying to stay warm. Just before lunch, after we&#8217;d all been in the rain and the cold far too much for one day, DI-Hard was called down again. Only to be sent away after a while because the officials were cold.<br />
Apparently, they didn&#8217;t notice the runny noses, blue lips, and shivering bodies of the competitors.<br />
DI-Hard&#8217;s second race was considerably better than our first, coming through with a time of 2:16, knocking five seconds off our previous time. It was good to have Arnold at the drum again. But it wasn&#8217;t good enough to win &#8212; we came second. We were beat out by last year&#8217;s grand champions. We weren&#8217;t too upset about that.<br />
I also race for the Red Dragons, who came up later that afternoon. This was a small race, as there were only four men&#8217;s teams. (By comparison, there were over 12 women&#8217;s teams, three of whom were from the same club.) This was a race I was looking forward to. Arnold guided us through a visualization (as most of the teams did before a race) and a stretch.<br />
We entered the lane, lined up, rolled to a start, and 2:05 later, were flying past the finish line. The next nearest boat was over a boat length behind (so I&#8217;m told).<br />
Races ended for the day with what&#8217;s called the Beer Run. This is when a group of teams (the competitive teams, I think) race for, well, beer. A keg of it, so I&#8217;m told. Dragoneers (who had done exceptionally well all day) didn&#8217;t win, unfortunately.<br />
Alex and I took off for home. That night, we went over to her family&#8217;s friend&#8217;s house, not far from the University. This was the family of her best friend, Rebecca, and where her father and stepmother were staying while in town. It was a chance to meet Rebecca&#8217;s parents (Rebecca is still in Costa Rica) and mutual friends visiting from Rocky Mountain House.<br />
Dinner was awkward, but not because I was the &#8220;new guy&#8221;. It was because of a freakish little event that only seems to happen in movies and coming-of-age TV shows, where the new boy thorough screws up in front of the parents. In my case, it wasn&#8217;t because of anything that I did myself. It was because of the chair I was sitting on.<br />
Now, I&#8217;m not overweight. In fact, I&#8217;m pretty much in line with what I should weigh for my height. But that didn&#8217;t stop the chair under me from creaking, cracking, bending, and finally breaking. It happened over a couple of seconds, so in theory I could have reacted more quickly. But I didn&#8217;t. Before I knew it, I was sitting on the floor, amidst a mass of shattered wood. There was no laughter, just stunned silence.<br />
This definitely ranked high in my list of Uncomfortable Moments.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay too long, leaving just after 20:00. Alex and I were both exhausted from the day, and Alex wasn&#8217;t feeling very well, either. When we parted ways that night, Alex commented that she might not be able to make it out the next morning.<br />
The phone rang at 6:01. Alex&#8217;s condition hadn&#8217;t improved much. We talked about it for a while and decided that she should stay home at least until she felt well enough to come down. Yes, there is the issue of letting the team down. Somewhere, you have to draw that line. I knew that, somehow, we&#8217;d make it without her, even if just for a while.<br />
Sunday was cold and wet, though it (thankfully) never really rained. Running into Bonnie and Chris upon my arrival, I dropped the bomb that Alex wasn&#8217;t coming. Bonnie immediately freaked &#8212; how do we balance a boat with one less person? We couldn&#8217;t register a new person easily (though it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered &#8212; the officials never checked) and we&#8217;d be out one person&#8217;s weight on one side.<br />
DI-Hard was one of the first teams up again, and we were down at the docks ready to run. It was calm, the wind having died overnight. The reservoir was glass. This was going to be a good race. Arnold lined us up, and we shifted Carrie to the other side to balance things out (how that worked, I&#8217;ll never understand).<br />
Despite all the preparation and focus, the heart just wasn&#8217;t there. We didn&#8217;t paddle well, we didn&#8217;t have the timing, and the results showed it. We were not happy at all with our first race. Arnold tried to bolster our spirits, but it just wasn&#8217;t working.<br />
Good news hit us not long after we got back to the tent &#8212; Alex was going to make it after all. Things had settled and she was ready to roll. She found us down at the docks as we were watching other teams display their muster.<br />
DI-Hard&#8217;s fourth race was the one we were meant to run. It was timed, it was solid. We didn&#8217;t win, but we didn&#8217;t care, either. We knew it was good, and our time showed it &#8212; 2:15. Not much better than the previous day, but Alex wasn&#8217;t the only one feeling a bit down &#8212; Graham was also well under the weather, so probably hadn&#8217;t been able to put in his all (he has the longest reach on the team, and can use it well).<br />
The Men&#8217;s Final came up soon after. Mark and I were already quite high from the DI-Hard&#8217;s run, so were looking forward to this one. The Red Dragons had met before the race, and discussed that we were not only going for the gold, we were going to try and break the two minute mark. It was something we all thought was possible.<br />
I thought Arnold might actually force his larynx out from the way he was yelling. The boat moved in surges like I&#8217;d never felt before. It was so bad that my outside foot slipped three times off the support, causing us to lose time and momentum. It was probably because of me that we didn&#8217;t break the two minute mark.<br />
Towards the finish line, we were all grunting in unison, powering our way through the strokes. All I could hear was the screaming onshore as teams cheered the racers on. When we finished, we all looked at Arnold for the results. All he did was smile and hold up one finger.<br />
The high continued right up until the finals were announced. At that point, the proverbial crap hit the fan.<br />
The festival breaks everyone into divisions: A, B, and C. Generally, the better you are, the higher you rank. Dragoneers are always A. Last year, DI-Hard was the C champion, and we were looking to be the B champion. Imagine our surprise to learn that we were in Division A&#8230;<br />
&#8230;and our total dismay to find out we were in the Consolation race. No medals.<br />
This sparked a huge furor in the team. How the hell could this have happened? What the hell was a &#8220;consolation race&#8221;? Hey, you did well! You did so well that we&#8217;ll let you race again just for the heck of it! To say that we were ticked off is putting it mildly. Even more so when we saw that slower teams had gotten into the medal round of Division A, and faster teams were in the medal round of Division C.<br />
Somehow, we&#8217;d ended up being too good for Division B, but not good enough for Division A.<br />
This is when Arnold straightened us out. According to the system, it&#8217;s luck of the draw. You race who you race against &#8212; there&#8217;s no planning aside from names drawn from a hat. If you win, you get three points; second gets two points; third gets one. Points are tallied and that&#8217;s how you end up in the race you end up in. By that measure, we were the seventh best team out of 45 teams. By last year&#8217;s rankings, we would have been the Division B winners.<br />
No, we weren&#8217;t racing for a medal. We were now racing for ourselves. Screw the official nature of everything, we were out to prove a point: You want to come up with a completely moronic way of organizing a series of races, that&#8217;s your problem. We&#8217;re not about to be shown the door that easily. We were determined to win that race, and post a better time than some of the teams in the Division A finals.<br />
Two teams didn&#8217;t show up for the Division C consolation. Couldn&#8217;t really blame them, either. Spirit Dragons came in second. Dynasty, a better team than DI-Hard, won the Division C finals. No Topmade teams made Division B (go figure), so we cheered on whoever we could.<br />
Division A consolation came up, and we were back in the boat again. Arnold was there, telling us that we had already done better than last year&#8217;s festival, medal or no medal. He looked us square in the eyes and said that he&#8217;d waited for five years to get a first in the Calgary festival, which we did with the men&#8217;s team. It didn&#8217;t matter if there was a medal at the end, it was the progress that mattered. It was how we showed our mettle then that would prove how we would perform in the future.<br />
The team had never been that focused. We ran the best race that DI-Hard probably has ever done. We were barely a second slower than the previous run, but it didn&#8217;t matter &#8212; we&#8217;d won. For that, we were happy. All of Topmade (except Arnold and the Dragoneers, already out to their final) waited for us at the top of the dock, to shake our hands. Nah, we didn&#8217;t win a medal. Somehow, I don&#8217;t think that really would have made a difference.<br />
The Dragoneers were against the two toughest teams: Crew Yahoo and the Edmonton Dragon Boat Club. (Trico Select was also in the race, but &#8230; well, to put it as succinctly as possible, there were never in it to begin with.) For the first 250 meters, we had no idea where the various boats were (out of the three, anyway). But by the 400 metre mark, the Dragoneers were pulling away. And they poured it on.<br />
I think we all went deaf when they crossed the line first. This was turning into a banner year for Topmade.<br />
The Women&#8217;s final was last, but certainly not least. Sang (DI-Hard&#8217;s captain) and not quite half of the Dragoneers went for the Phoenix boat. They were up against several strong competitors, including the Magic Spindles, who had defeated Phoenix before.<br />
There is a reason the women&#8217;s team is named &#8220;Phoenix&#8221;.<br />
We could hear Arnold at the 250 metre mark. Although he was steering, he was yelling so loudly that it was possible to hear him over the crowd. Spindles were pouring it on, but Phoenix&#8217;s form was almost perfect. They crossed the line to a tremendous cheer. I think Alex had her ears plugged from the cacophony.<br />
Trouble started not long afterwards. One of the boats (originally thought to be Phoenix) protested. Something wasn&#8217;t right. We couldn&#8217;t figure out why the heck we&#8217;d protest our own win. *That* wasn&#8217;t right. As it turned out, it was the Spindles &#8212; they&#8217;d smacked the starting gate on the way out and hadn&#8217;t had the run they wanted. They would have to race again.<br />
Topmade jeered the announcement so loudly that you couldn&#8217;t hear the PA over the club. This was just ridiculous. These people had just poured out everything in a hard race, and because of one steerer&#8217;s mistake, all would suffer? Several of the Phoenix women were downing whole bottles of water &#8212; the ones on the Dragoneers probably felt like giving up, even if just for a moment.<br />
The six teams went back to the start line, over 500 metres away, and prepared for the second race. (Incidentally, dragon boats always move under their own power when loaded with rowers &#8212; they are never towed.) Most of us felt for our poor clubmates &#8212; we knew what it was like to finish a hard race. But to then jump into a second one? That was torture.<br />
The PA system cracked with the radio chatter echoing the instructions from the start line: various boats being jockeyed into position. Hangs were clasped, stomachs tightened, foreheads knotted, and breaths held. Even when the start tone sounded, there wasn&#8217;t much sound from the crowd.<br />
There was no way to tell how the teams were doing. We could almost feel the exhaustion from the team. We all looked expectantly, hopefully, as they all crossed the 250 metre mark, almost dead-tied. The cheers started around the 300 metre mark, and rose steadily as the boats closed in on the finish line. If we could have heard Arnold&#8217;s voice over the din, it would have probably been like listening to a lion&#8217;s roar.<br />
Somehow, all the hopes of every member of Topmade must&#8217;ve made it out to the Phoenix boat. It started to pull ahead, probably as a result of a power 10. From the 400 metre line to the finish, the gap just got larger and larger. On the first run, they had paddled with 154 strokes (yes, someone counted). On the second, 186. Despite the extra run, the extra exertion, and the sheer power required to pull off two wins in a row, the cheer from Phoenix nearly brought tears to the eyes of everyone on shore. It was a well-deserved win.<br />
The Topmade club stood at the top of the dock, welcoming back every single paddler from the final race, handing them bottles of water (we barely made a dent in our supply). The women were happy, but exhausted. Some had to be helped away. Even Phoenix, despite their win, showed their fatigue. Even then, happiness was obvious.<br />
Topmade cheered our victories back at the tent, and took the time for presentations of our own. Arnold, possibly the hardest-working guy in the club, and Nick, who keeps everything working (though no-one really knows how), were given carbon fibre paddles after a collection from the teams. Then all of us posed for pictures.<br />
The awards ceremony took place at the beer tent, after the band finally took a break. It was something else to go up with the men&#8217;s team for our gold medal. There&#8217;s something to be said for having that chunk of metal around your neck that just shows you&#8217;ve done something. Mark and I both lamented that the rest of DI-Hard wouldn&#8217;t get that experience.<br />
After the awards, the festival effectively ended. It was late &#8212; about 19:30, and most of us were tired. The women in the finals had been quite giddy with what was left of their adrenaline, but even they were passing out. It was time to go home.<br />
Despite the complaints about festival organization (poor tent locations, bad timing on the first day, and an utterly ridiculous ranking system), it was a good time. And I look forward to next year.<br />
Especially after I modify my workout routine a bit.<br />

		<p>Travelling is never easy. Especially when my best friend Murphy is along for the ride.<br />
I rose late (catching up with sleep lost the night before), and met up with Craig, Jill, and her daughter Jamie in the concierge level for breakfast. Craig did a short presentation on the tools he has for managing the pay-per-click materials for the Hyatt programme. I hadn&#8217;t seen it before, so watched with interest. I realized that like with everything else we have, Craig has a great deal to offer for SEM presentations and theory, and that the two of us really need to get ourselves organized within Critical Mass.<br />

I should have woken with another hangover. Especially since I had slept only about three hours. It was the last of the seminar, and I didn&#8217;t want to miss anything.<br />
I called Craig&#8217;s room once to see if they were going for breakfast. There was no answer. I wasn&#8217;t surprised.<br />

		<p>Search Engine Strategies 2004, San Jose, California, Day 3<br />
I wasn&#8217;t hungover. Since I had only two beers at the Google party (and they ran out!), I wasn&#8217;t really reeling from any overdoses. I skipped the swim in favour of a little extra sleep.<br />
Craig finally pulled me out of bed with a phone call, and we headed up for breakfast. Our tales of the previous night were fairly tame. It was ironic that the &#8220;upstart&#8221; of the industry, and now current reigning king, also had the most conservative party.<br />
Grabbing our stuff on the way back down, we proceeded to the first event of the day: an Executive Roundtable, featuring VPs from Yahoo!, AOL Search, Ask Jeeves, and MSN Search. (Obviously absent was Google, but the SEC doesn&#8217;t allow them to postulate on anything this close to their IPO. Danny jokingly offered to forecast on their behalf.)<br />
On the whole, the session was a bit of a wash. The AOL guy kept talking in circles and didn&#8217;t really say anything of note. The Yahoo! guy was an old hat, and had done this quite a lot. His measured speeches and &#8220;insights&#8221; were crafted to not say much, but say it well. The Ask Jeeves representative was possibly the most informative, but with them being #8 on the list, he really didn&#8217;t stand to lose anything by being there. All three of them eyed the MSN guy very carefully. Microsoft has been tinkering away in their garage for a while, and you can already hear the roar of the massive engine they&#8217;ve been building in secret. Everyone knows what they&#8217;ve been doing, but the question is what impact it will have.<br />
Craig and I were not impressed with the MSN guy &#8212; he kept giving the company line. Following the roundtable, we were commenting about this very fact. Just off my left shoulder, I spied a woman listening in to our conversation. After a couple of moments, she stepped forward and introduced herself. Anna, from MSN.<br />
(At this point, you&#8217;d think we should probably take back the things we were saying. We didn&#8217;t. We meant every word, and apparently that&#8217;s what she was interested in.)<br />
The three of us chatted for a while about MSN and their plans for world domination (okay, I added that last bit &#8212; Anna didn&#8217;t mention anything about that). We knew that once MSN gets their search system up and running, they&#8217;ll drop Yahoo! as their search provider. Our question to her was, what will happen to their pay-per-click program? Overture currently powers MSN&#8217;s PPC system &#8212; so are Overture&#8217;s days numbered?<br />
Anna, although only having been with MSN for four months, knew the answer. Of course, she didn&#8217;t tell us. One advantage of having listened to American politics on TV for so many years, and having a degree in rhetoric, we have a great ability for disseminating the truth. But not like it wasn&#8217;t much of a stretch, anyway. Without actually saying it, Anna told us that while they value their partnership with Overture, Microsoft does want to flex its own muscles. One day, Bruce Clay will have to update his diagram so that the MSN circle no longer has arrows going into it.<br />
Successful Site Architecture came up next for me. This was a particularly interesting topic. Although a Fundamental course, it shed a few points on the work that I do every day. Nothing new, mind you, but confirmation of the direction we&#8217;ve been going in. (Although, when I get back, I need to change a few standards.) Everything I&#8217;ve seen paled in comparison to Trademark Brand Protection Issues. Despite the fact that my blood sugar level bottomed right out (I feel asleep for a short while), the issues raised in the seminar will be extremely valuable for us and our clients, as we&#8217;re sure to run into the same problems. Finally was the Very Vertical session, which was a discussion about other search engines and directories than the big ones &#8212; engines that are dedicated to specific industry and topical verticals. It wasn&#8217;t a very full session, but should have been &#8212; this wa a great session full of strong information.<br />
The last session also shed light on the post-Yahoo! party. Everyone seemed to know that there would be a party, the question was who would hold it, and where? It would be Eon Media, a division of SBI.Razorfish (one of our competitors). The location? The Flying Pig Pub. I made sure to grab some cards to pass them around to the gang, so they&#8217;d know where to go.<br />
Following the main sessions was Danny&#8217;s Evening Forum. Basically, his chance to do a Phil Donohue schtick, run around with a microphone, and have the audience be the panel. Questions were raised, questions were answered, and the results were exceptionally interesting. First, we need a form of Better Business Bureau to handle all the black hat and rogue SEM firms that are giving the rest of us a bad name. Second, although we know MSN will dramatically shift the search landscape, none of us believe that it&#8217;s going to completely steamroller Google or Yahoo! &#8212; it&#8217;ll be roughly a three-way tie.<br />
After a quick run up to our rooms to dump our bags, Craig and I headed over to The Tech Museum of San Jose for Yahoo!&#8217;s soiree. This was the number two search engine&#8217;s attempt to make up for Google&#8217;s bash the night before. Not nearly as extravangant as Google&#8217;s, Yahoo!&#8217;s party was ripe with food and drink, and a very fun environment to play around in. Museum staff were on hand to help us out with some of the exhibits (a demonstration of a rocket pack, surgical implants and how they work, and virtual scanning to name a few). Unlike Google, Yahoo! didn&#8217;t run out of beer (though there was a fear they would).<br />
I took a spin on the rocket pack simulator. You sit in a large, very uncomfortable chair that has three pads that support it on a cushion of air. You sit underneath a mockup of a satellite that has three circles of blinking green lights. The idea is to guide the chair so that a red light (projected from the chair onto the satellite) covers the green lights. That set will go out, and the next illuminate. It was fun.<br />
Especially since I&#8217;d already had a couple of beers.<br />
The museum was reminiscent of the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, with a lot of hands-on experiments. Guests either spent their time playing around, or stood and chatted with others. It was a better networking experience than the Google party, but we were still hampered by size and the fact that we were scattered across two floors (with the ground floor in between, for added separation).<br />
Around 21:00, Brad, Megan, and I decided that it was time to move to the second party. The Yahoo! party was showing signs of beginning to wrap up, and we wanted to hit the next venue before it was too late.<br />
Well, at least Brad was supposed to come with us. Somewhere along the line, we lost him. Instead, we picked up another fellow SEMer from Vancouver, whose name I now forget, and headed out in search of our destination. A vague map and an accurate address finally brought us to the bar. There were only about 20 people there upon arrival. It was only a short time before the crowds started to arrive, Craig appearing just before them.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before the Eon Media party was turning into another LookSmart bash. Booze flowed freely, people shouted above the din of laughter and music, and we all generally carried on until last call brought an end to things around 1:15. Craig, Megan, Brad, and I headed out into the night, trying to find something new.<br />
Which was a lot harder than it sounds. San Jose pretty shuts down at about 1:30. The hotel&#8217;s bar closes at midnight! That didn&#8217;t stop Craig from acquiring two bottles of wine from the restaurant&#8217;s manager (who even brought them up to Craig&#8217;s room).<br />
Nor did it put a pause on Brad, who decided that he didn&#8217;t want wine &#8212; he wanted beer. While we were waiting at the bar for the wine to be prepared, Brad decided to acquire his beverage of choice. The bar was technically closed, so wouldn&#8217;t sell him any. Yet, a moment later, I saw Brad holding a Samuel Adams. How on Earth he&#8217;d produced it out of thin air was obvious when I saw the swinging kitchen door just behind him.<br />
Laughing at his audaciousness, I commented that he hadn&#8217;t thought about the rest of us. Brad smiled and vanished again, returning with two Heinekens. Surprisingly enough, the bar staff didn&#8217;t notice, nor did the manager comment on the three cold beers we brought to Craig&#8217;s room.<br />
The four of us went up to Craig&#8217;s room to engage in continued conversation and &#8220;wine tasting&#8221; until well into the wee hours of the morning. Brad didn&#8217;t last too long, having consumed far too much beer and booze for his own good. He staggered his way out the door and headed off for his hotel, somewhere in the general vincinity of I Don&#8217;t Know, and I&#8217;ll Find It Eventually.<br />
The three of us continued until somewhere well after 5:00, after we&#8217;d polished off 2/3 of a bottle of red wine apiece. Megan and I were ready to pass out, Craig not far behind. I was more-or-less ejected from the room; Megan crashed with Craig.<br />
It was already lightening outside when I crawled into bed.<br />

		<p>Search Engine Strategies 2004, San Jose, California, Day 2<br />
The alarm started at 6:30. I hit snooze several times before I finally had the realization that I needed to get out of bed. Almost instantly, I knew that I was going to have an ill-feeling day. My stomach was empty and rotten from all the gin and beer, and my head felt like a boxer&#8217;s practice bag.<br />
I tried to take in a swim before breakfast. I wasn&#8217;t able to make much of it. Alcohol poisoning usually retards physical ability, and exertion is a little difficult. But a little raise in the heart rate is better than nothing.<br />
I went right up for breakfast after showering. I didn&#8217;t call Craig, as I figured he had to be feeling at least as bad as I did, if not worse since he drank more than me, and was out longer. A heaping batch of eggs and the greasiest bacon I could find was a start to me feeling better.<br />
First up was the Keynote speech, delivered by our host moderator, Danny Sullivan. Danny is the most recognized search expert. It also doesn&#8217;t hurt that he&#8217;s a really good presenter. Craig missed it due to a conference call that one our our project managers scheduled him into despite the fact that he was 2,000 kilometres away.<br />
That kind of annoyed me. No, actually, I take that back. It really pissed me off. Craig and I are here for not only our benefit, but also the company&#8217;s, and he missed the entire morning session because one person (who didn&#8217;t even really have the proper authority to boss Craig around, in my humble opinion) decided that their priorities exceeded everything else. I don&#8217;t appreciate that level of short-sightedness, especially where plans aren&#8217;t fully concrete. It&#8217;s unacceptable, in my mind. Craig and I both suffer as a result, since Craig&#8217;s absence meant two sessions we wouldn&#8217;t see.<br />
Anyway, I went through four sessions, not including the keynote speech. (I would go until well into the afternoon before I found Craig again and found out what had been going on.)<br />
The keynote speech was important. It was a chance for Danny Sullivan (the host moderator) to make his points about Search Engine Marketing and its power and future. In particular was the addressing of Seth Godin&#8217;s accusation that SEO is black magic, something I felt was quite inaccurate. (I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s had many a retort since then.) I won&#8217;t doubt that it *looks* like black magic, but when you deal with a million variables, and have no control over 999,999 of them, you can&#8217;t always predict the results.<br />
(And you thought I was going to mention something about any sufficiently advanced technology resembles magic, didn&#8217;t you?)<br />
The Organic Listings Forum was quite solid, delivering a lot of very interesting information about how to handle listings without having to pay for them (a common problem in the industry &#8212; all the bang with none of the buck). Of particular interest was seeing Bruce Clay, one of the SEM heavyweights. Dynamic Web Sites, though a Fundamental track session, did shed a couple of lights and ideas on the the problems we face on a near-daily basis on the MBUSA account.<br />
During the lunch break, I made a point of circulating through the exhibit hall, seeing what Critical Mass is up against for competition (there&#8217;s a bit, but not really anyone like us, surprisingly enough), and what other services are readily available. Some we might want to offer, but in the end there&#8217;s just other things we need to be aware of.<br />
I met Mike and Albert from SiteLab (what I would assume is a competitor to Critical Mass, based out of Houston). We chatted about our respective clients and the challenges they often face. They have the US Navy as one of their clients &#8212; government contracts are simultaneously the best and worst ones to have.<br />
After lunch, I dove into Search Engines and Web Server Issues. Sadly, the session was light on content and didn&#8217;t really provide anything we couldn&#8217;t have read from the PowerPoint presentations. Last up was the Optimizing Flash session, which is something near and dear to my heart (as I am regularly touted around the office as being a Flash hater &#8212; which I am not, I just don&#8217;t agree with the frequency of use and the typical implementation). The only real thing I got out of that was the verification that while some search engines can scan Flash, they don&#8217;t really index on it, and that you shouldn&#8217;t plan on Flash ever being indexed.<br />
Craig and I met up for a bite to eat after the sessions. Still hung over from last night&#8217;s little fiasco, we decided that we *absolutely* needed to eat something before we went out for tonight&#8217;s little soiree: The Google Dance.<br />
No, it wasn&#8217;t a *dance* per se. (Although there was dancing.) It&#8217;s a party &#8212; a big one. The name stems from something in the SEM industry called the &#8220;Google Dance&#8221;. This is when Google updates its algorithms, usually about once a month. Sometimes, the effect is minimal, and it&#8217;s barely noticed. Other times, the changes are huge, as it was with a particular update known as &#8220;Florida&#8221;. This succeeded in changing the long-standing results for thousands of websites, causing quite the ruckus. It seems very appropriate that the name of the party should be a play off the one thing that our industry actually fears from Google.<br />
They supplied buses. Their office is a 20 minute drive on the freeways from downtown San Jose. (A cab ride would have been something expensive.) After powering back an appetizer plate and a couple of beers, we hopped in line with Brad, the creator and host of Search Engine Radio. Craig had met Brad at the Toronto conference and is a regular listener (Brad says that Craig is his only fan). I&#8217;d listen, but the timing is lousy for me, since it&#8217;s always when I&#8217;m in meetings.<br />
Upon arriving, we were all handed t-shirts bearing the name of the party, and ventured on in. Google&#8217;s offices are at the old headquarters of SGI (Silicon Graphics). They&#8217;re slowly expanding into all the available space, but for now only occupy about half of it. The courtyard in the middle is where all the hubbub was taking place.<br />
Like all of the other parties we&#8217;d experienced so far, this was free. Didn&#8217;t cost us a cent, outside of the flight and hotel. (Okay, that costs Critical Mass&#8230;) Quite a party, too. Free drinks, free food, a live band (Ozomati, whose music defies simply classification, but was exceptionally good), a live DJ, Ben and Jerry&#8217;s ice cream in INSANE quantities, giveaways, and demos of all their products.<br />
Oh, and they tried to recruit new employees from the plethora of folk there.<br />
Craig, Brad, and I wandered about a bit, seeing was there was, having some beers, talking with other people, eating, and generally taking advantage of the situation. (We joked about trying to break in and steal the algorthims, but we wouldn&#8217;t have even been able to get into the stairwells with all the security guards about.)<br />
With all the people there, it wasn&#8217;t surprising that I eventually lost track of them and ran solo for a while. I ran into Nikki and Megan again, and chatted about our pasts, what we did for hobbies, and what we thought of Google&#8217;s impending IPO (officially announced tonight to be next Tuesday, 10 August).<br />
There was a lot of head nodding between the three of us that this might be the start of the fall of Google. This was Google&#8217;s last hurrah as a private company. Next week, their staff will become millionaires overnight, there will be flashy, new cars in the driveways, and we&#8217;ll probably see a brief glimpse of the dot-com era for a while. But only a while.<br />
Reality will set in again, and the pressure will be on Google to continually perform and produce. I&#8217;ll be surprised if this party happens again next year, particularly if it happens at the same level.<br />
Google&#8217;s stock price will be the biggest question. It&#8217;s currently listed to start at USD$108. At that price, it&#8217;s well out of the range of most people, and only in the reach of investors. The biggest question is whether it will sell at that price, or if people will force it down. Undoubtedly, some will buy, and undoubtedly, the price will fall. It must &#8212; the dot-com era is over, and Google or not, the current reality can&#8217;t support a price like that.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s what we think now. A week from now might prove otherwise.<br />
The party started to quieten down when news spread that Google had run out of beer. When we heard it for the first time, the reaction was one of shock &#8212; how do you run out of beer? It&#8217;s like running out of water! Sure, there was still wine and some mixed stuff, but beer is the life blood! (Okay, yes, I&#8217;d only had two and wasn&#8217;t having any others, but that wasn&#8217;t the point!)<br />
Nikki and Megan left about 21:30 or so. Nikki was tired, having been on her feet all day, and being five month&#8217;s pregnant doesn&#8217;t help. Megan, like the rest of us, was exhausted from last night&#8217;s alcohol-fueled marathon.<br />
Craig had already left, having gone back to the hotel to rest. (I didn&#8217;t know for sure, but since I couldn&#8217;t find him&#8230;) I boarded a bus about 22:05, and was in my room by about 22:30. But I wasn&#8217;t exhausted, and decided to rest and relax a bit. Tomorrow&#8217;s another day of sessions and education.<br />
And the Yahoo party.<br />

		<p>Search Engine Strategies 2004, San Jose, California, Day 1<br />
After an exceptionally sound sleep, I awoke to get my day started. I had planned to start all my days with a workout (I&#8217;ve been slacking for the last little while, and need to get back into the habit), but ran out of room in my bag to bring my workout clothes.<br />
I gave yoga a shot. If it weren&#8217;t for the slippery carpet, I might have done a better job (didn&#8217;t bring my yoga mat, either).<br />
Craig and I met up in the Concierge Room on the 26th floor. Bacon, eggs, fruit, and a bit of juice. Far more than the muffins and pastries of the conference&#8217;s continental breakfast.<br />
Following our morning meal, we headed down for registration. Didn&#8217;t take long &#8212; all we had to do was provide our names. That got us our name tags, and our bag o&#8217; goodies. (Which actually contained a lot of useless stuff, too.) We spent some time trying to figure out which seminars we were going to, specifically trying to hit as many of the topics as we could. Not too easy, as there are at least four each period, and there are four periods a day.<br />
I went to four sessions: Using Search for Market Research, Search Term Research &amp; Targeting, Personalizing Search, and Search Detours. Search for Market Research was a good perspective change, if light on other content. I fell sleep during Search Term Research &amp; Targeting. Craig had recommended it because it was a good introduction. However, I&#8217;m quite a ways past introductory level, so it was a tad dull. Having a long-standing beef with personalization, I wanted to see if the Personalizing Search had anything of value. It didn&#8217;t. Lots of talk about products, but no promise of effectiveness, nor any real content for marketers to handle the situation where the same query will generate different results for different people. It also didn&#8217;t help that the presenters weren&#8217;t the most interesting. The poorly-named Search Detours (most of the presenters renamed it Search Shortcuts). Like Personalization, it was very thin on content, and most of what was presented had no practical application from a marketing perspective.<br />
Craig and I ducked out a bit early. We had some time before the Overture party, so went in search of some shopping. Craig was thinking of a new shirt, and I needed a swimsuit (guess what else I forgot).<br />
Macy&#8217;s is supposed to be a great department store. You think I could find one swimsuit that was appropriate? They were all beach suits, and what ones I could find that weren&#8217;t too bad where all XL or XXL. Go figure. Luckily, a Copeland&#8217;s Sports store just outside in the mall had what I needed.<br />
Returning to the hotel, we got ready for the Overture party, held at the bar in the Hilton next door. The party started at 18:30, and was pretty deserted when we arrived. Craig initially wanted to leave and come back, but before long, as swinging.<br />
LookSmart staged what I can only call one of the most ballsy coups I&#8217;ve seen in a long time. They were running around, handing out cards for a party they were holding at a different location (not far away). I can only assume that Overture wasn&#8217;t particularly happy about that.<br />
At the Overture party, I met Todd. Todd has a website that promotes Costa Rican destinations. I&#8217;m finding it quite interesting that there are so many people who know a lot about Costa Rica lately &#8212; it&#8217;s almost as if every person I meet has been there. It&#8217;s insane. But at the very least, I have yet another information source to use as Alex and I try to organize our vacation in January.<br />
Craig bailed a little earlier than I for the LookSmart party; I followed soon after. The party was held at Pete Escovedo&#8217;s Latin &amp; Jazz Club. LookSmart had booked the whole place to themselves, and you had to be with the conference to gain access.<br />
It was a small venue, once a single-screen theatre. It&#8217;s now an intimate little club that features the music of Pete Escovedo, who is a Latin Jazz legend. (At least, that&#8217;s what the invite card says. I&#8217;ve never heard of the guy.) The music was hot, the environment lively, and drinks free.<br />
I was quickly introduced to Megan and Nikki, who work for Urchin Software. They&#8217;re up as exhibitors, and were enjoying themselves hanging out with the rest of the troublemakers. (Nikki is five month&#8217;s pregnant, so wasn&#8217;t enjoying herself as much as she probably wanted to.)<br />
Craig then introduced me to gin and tonic, a drink I had formerly snubbed because I dislike the taske of tonic water. Instead, I found the drink exceptionally tasty, and realized why the British have taken such a liking to them.<br />
This, it would seem, was my downfall. (As Craig later commented, it&#8217;s a bad sign when I suddenly, and very loudly, exclaim: &#8220;This is the best [expletive deleted] thing I&#8217;ve ever had!&#8221;) I had started off with beer at Overture, and had switched to hard liquor. I don&#8217;t know how many I had, but it was too many. By at least five. When we finally headed back to the Marriott, I knew I&#8217;d had too much. The beer in the hotel bar finally did me in, and I had to leave Craig and Jill Whalen in the lounge and retreat to bed.<br />
I was going to hurt the next day, and I wouldn&#8217;t be the only one&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The trip to San Jose wasn&#8217;t the most enjoyable I&#8217;ve had, but it was far from a bad experience.<br />
Craig and I breezed through security. It goes to figure that it you arrive with plenty of time at the airport, there won&#8217;t be a line for you to have to wait through. If you don&#8217;t arrive with sufficient time, the lines will be exceedingly long. We were through in minutes, with more than enough time to spare.<br />
I had to lie at the immigration desk, though. Critical Mass has had so much trouble trying to get across the border into the States that Craig and I played the role of tourists &#8212; we&#8217;re only here to visit. That&#8217;s the problem with crossing the border &#8212; since 9/11, the privileges that Canadians have had crossing the border have been greatly reduced. Previously, all we had to say was that we were Canadian, and that was enough. Now, we have to have passports and papers. It&#8217;s ridiculous, especially when we&#8217;re coming here just for a conference.<br />
What kind of conference, you ask? One on search engines. Yeah, it sounds kinda dopey. It&#8217;s the Search Engine Strategies 2004 San Jose show, one of the single largest conferences in this industry. It&#8217;s big. Really big. And Craig and I have to make sure that we really make the most of it and see what we can do.<br />
Our flight to San Jose was in two segments: the first to Denver, the second to San Jose. And what we didn&#8217;t really know until we checked in was that we had a nearly three-hour delay in Denver. Not the most rivetting place to be stuck. Craig and I passed the time discussing business over beers at a quasi-French restaurant.<br />
(Hmm. That&#8217;s not entirely accurate. More like a bistro with a French name. In the middle of Colorado, in a massive airport. Go figure.)<br />
The flight to San Jose was late by nearly 30 minutes. A bit rocky, but uneventful, otherwise. United Airlines has gone cheap, though &#8212; you have to pay additionally for meals on domestic flights now. At least beverages are still free.<br />
San Jose&#8217;s airport is small &#8212; we had to use stairs to get off the plane. Three baggage carousels, kept quite a distance from the plane we arrived on, weren&#8217;t enough for the flights coming in &#8212; it took a while for our two measly bags to appear. But at least they did.<br />
The hotel was more trouble than I would have liked, but only because Mastercard hasn&#8217;t processed my payment yet. A royal pain in the butt, but not the end of the world. It just means that I&#8217;ll have to revisit the front desk in the next couple of days to get the issue sorted out. Since it&#8217;s a Sunday, I&#8217;m not going to get upset. If Tuesday rolls around and things are still amiss, there might be trouble.<br />
The conference doesn&#8217;t actually start until tomorrow, but already the cast is beginning to assemble. Craig and I took the chance to whip down to the hotel&#8217;s bar to see who was about, and have a beer or two. Two of the speakers were there, along with several other attendees (at least, I would assume as such). We paired off with a couple of Heinekins, and went about ordering some food. We hadn&#8217;t eaten since Denver, and it was now almost 22:00. Appetizer platters, including crab cakes, shrimp tempura, basically what I&#8217;d call a lobster pogo, and something called black truffle popcorn (although it didn&#8217;t taste like a truffle). Pricey, but tasty.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay down for too long. We were both wiped from all the travelling. We cleared the bill, said good night to those around us, and headed for bed.<br />
Certainly the next few days are going to be interesting.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This has been another crazy week. Lots that I&#8217;ve done, general mayhem in and out of the office, and this morning, I&#8217;m boarding a plane for San Jose.<br />
Recap: We&#8217;re gearing up for the Calgary Dragon Boat Festival, which runs August 7 and 8 at the Glenmore Reservoir. (Those of you in the Calgary area should come down &#8212; apparently, it&#8217;s a big event.) This mean the DI-Hard (the team I&#8217;m on) had practices Sunday and Monday. That was hard, only because Sunday would have been an ideal day for floating down the Bow River. It was 32 degrees here.<br />
Monday&#8217;s practice was, simply put, hell. Arnold (our coach and drummer) took us through a lot of drills, including three race pieces. As we were returning to the dock, our sides aching and our shoulders collapsing, we were doing pause drills. Basically, take a stroke and then pause until told to take another. It&#8217;s to practice timing. We were hearing &#8220;hit!&#8230;. hit!&#8230;. hit!&#8230;.&#8221; from Arnold, but were chanting in return: &#8220;hit ARNOLD!&#8230;. hit ARNOLD!&#8230;&#8221; He called it off once he realized what we were saying.<br />
Tuesday night was yet another practice, but this time for the Red Dragons, the Topmade men&#8217;s team. I&#8217;m the junior. Most of the others have been dragon boating for years. I&#8217;m a lightweight by comparison. Mark and I volunteered from DI-Hard to come out and give it our all. The men&#8217;s team really moves, and does things a little differently. Arnold is the coach here, too, and might also be the drummer. He guided us through similar drills to DI-Hard, with one major difference &#8212; we&#8217;re paddling with our eyes closed.<br />
Yep, closed.<br />
Sounds counter-intuitive, I know, but you&#8217;d be surprised how effective it is! Once you cut out all the other distractions, all you have is the sound of paddles hitting the water, and the surge of the boat. According to Arnold, we apparently had better timing with our eyes closed than we did with them open. Though I suspect our technique didn&#8217;t look so hot. We even did a practice race like that. It&#8217;s easier when you don&#8217;t know where the finishing line is.<br />
On the way back, doing pause drills (again) with our eyes closed, my rotator cuff officially gave out. I couldn&#8217;t hold the paddle up anymore. hankfully, it&#8217;s the last practice for a while, so I don&#8217;t have to worry too much. Still, it&#8217;s a little concerning.<br />
Now what&#8217;s the deal with San Jose? I&#8217;m going on business trip. My first since going to Cincinnati over four years ago (see [[Live from Cincinnati]]). But this is not for a client, it&#8217;s for a technical conference on search engine marketing. Yes, believe it or not, there is much more to search engines than just plugging in a couple of keywords and pressing &#8220;I&#8217;m Feeling Lucky!&#8221;. I already know a lot about them (relax, I ain&#8217;t gonna bore you about them here), but I need to know more. Believe it or not, it&#8217;s part of my job now.<br />
So I&#8217;m going to San Jose for five days with Craig (co-worker and fellow expert-to-be) and see what information we can glean. Hopefully, it will be fun. But I don&#8217;t have my hopes up. If we&#8217;re lucky, we&#8217;ll hit San Francisco. If we have time, which we won&#8217;t know until we get a better picture of the schedule.<br />
And on that note, I gotta run. Plane to catch. See y&#8217;all later!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like realizing that your garden sucks.<br />
When I bought the house, I couldn&#8217;t really see the backyard gardens &#8212; there was quite a lot of snow. That obscured pretty much everything worth seeing and worth hiding. So naturally, when summer rolled around, I was surprised by the plethora of vegetation that was growing from them.<br />
Sadly, mostly weeds. Pretty-looking weeds, in some cases, but still weeds.<br />
I woke up Sunday morning with a bolt of inspiration and purpose: I would landscape my backyard. Well, okay, maybe not something *quite* that drastic. I was at the very least going to clean up the two weed beds and make something of them. I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what that was going to entail, but I did know at the very least, they were going to look much better. The Wasteland of Weeds was about to come to an end.<br />
For Christmas last year, Mom had given me some money to hire a landscaping consultant to come in and do something with my rather large mess. (This was Mom&#8217;s way of suggesting that my gardens sucked. Not that I&#8217;m arguing that at all.) Due to other things getting in my way earlier in the year (dating Alex comes immediately to mind), I never got around to it. I figured that at the very least, I could put the money to use and do the landscaping myself.<br />
Scooting up to the Rona near Sunridge Mall in the Northeast, I went in search of a helpful Rona employee. (Yes, I could have gone to Home Depot as well, but I have a healthy dislike of talking with teenagers who think baby&#8217;s breath is something that comes from eating too much pabulum.) Luckily, I found Sandra, whom I would describe as a hard-core Calgary gardener.<br />
Yes, I was looking specifically for a Calgary gardener. Why? Because this city has some really bizarre weather, hard water, and soil conditions that challenge even the best of gardening experts. I needed someone who knew what they were doing. &#8216;Cuz I don&#8217;t. Most of my family has a green thumb. Mine&#8217;s black.<br />
I gave Sandra the basic view of what I wanted: something low-maintenance (I don&#8217;t want to be planting new flowers every year) that would take to my sometimes shady / sometimes sunny (depending on time of year and angle of the sun) backyard. Giving her the approximate sizes of the two gardens, we went off looking at what Rona had to offer. Being &#8220;late in the season&#8221; (I assume that means planting), there wasn&#8217;t a massive selection. But more than enough for my meagre needs.<br />
So began my horticultural buying spree. Plants of several varieties (hostas, junipers, lilies, baby&#8217;s breath, asters, small shrubs, echinaceas (not the kind for colds), yews, and a couple of things I can&#8217;t remember), three bags of landscaping soil, 150 feet of landscaping fabric, and a hand shovel.<br />
(Here&#8217;s a tip about the landscaping soil: Rona has an unwritten rule that if the bag is torn, they&#8217;ll give it to you for $1. But there&#8217;s a catch &#8212; you need a staff member to tell the cashier that the bag was torn, so it&#8217;s only $1. Otherwise, they&#8217;d have *everyone* tearing the bags open. Sandra was quite helpful in pointing that out.)<br />
Add onto that a set of outdoor lights to add some accent lighting to the longer garden, and I had a plan in motion. I had planned on getting some solar lights, so I wouldn&#8217;t have the additional cost of running cords, dealing with electric set ups, and the benefit of a photovoltaic cell for turning on and off. But Sandra and the electrical expert both warned me away from them. Apparently, they&#8217;re quite dim (the lights, not the staff members) and unless you&#8217;re in direct sunlight, won&#8217;t necessarily charge enough for use.<br />
Then there&#8217;s the cost. One solar lamp: $28. A 10-lamp kit (with transformer, wires, etc.): $25. You do the math.<br />
I managed to cram the whole lot into the Mini. (For those of you who think it&#8217;s not a big car, I offer this as evidence.) Dumping the load into my backyard, I set out to the task of cleaning things up.<br />
About an hour and a half later, two large piles of ex-weeds, two piles of shoots from the two trees in my backyard, and a pile of branches from the lilac bush (I need to really trim that sucker even more), I had brought the yard at least into a state where I could begin the landscaping work.<br />
Well, as soon as I assembled the lights. That took another half an hour.<br />
Step 1: Lay out the lights so you can snake out the 50 feet of low-voltage cord. Surprisingly enough, it was just the right length.<br />
Step 2: Roll out the landscaping fabric, being careful not to crush the two existing hostas and small red shrub (I have no idea what it is). Cut to length. Cut slits so the existing plants come through the sheet.<br />
Step 3: Layout the new plants so they have suitable spacing, have a good aesthetic arrangement, and are ordered by size (small in front, large in back).<br />
Step 4: Go get a beer.<br />
Step 5: With each plant, cut a triangular slit in the fabric where you want to put the particular foliage. Dug out a hole twice the size and 1.5 times as deep. Partially refill with landscape soil. Place unpotted plant into the hole, and fill the remaining space with landscape soil.<br />
Step 6: Repeat Step 5 until out of plants, or back gives out, whichever comes first. Grab another beer somewhere in the middle of all that.<br />
It didn&#8217;t help that it was over 30 degrees, even in the shade. To say that I was hot is putting it mildly. After six hours (from the time I got back home), I hadn&#8217;t even finished the one long garden. It was about then that I realized that Alex hadn&#8217;t come over (she had to work on Sunday) or had called. I figured it was time for a break.<br />
We would meet a little later at the Prince&#8217;s Island Park footbridge (over the Bow River), and walk over to Eau Claire Market for a little air hockey rematch. We haven&#8217;t had an air hockey game in a VERY long time (it was something we did almost religiously when we first started dating). I could say my performance was due to exhaustion, tight muscles, lack of proper food, but the simple fact is that Alex was better. We&#8217;ll just have to do another rematch at a later date.<br />
Returning home, I got back to tackling the smaller garden (I&#8217;d finished the large one before meeting up with Alex). That one required less work insofar as planting is concerned, but I had to move a lot of dirt around, as the bed was a little too low for my liking. Luckily, I had to dig out a lot of dirt to get the rest of the plants in place.<br />
Sadly, I would not finish in one shot, my efforts being thwarted by darkness and the onslaught of mosquitoes. (The ones out here are quite small, almost negligible, but they are now carrying West Nile Virus, and it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m too keen on catching.) The remaining few plants will have to wait a couple of more days yet.<br />
Now if I can just figure out what to do with all those branches&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend, Alex and I went camping. It was the first time I&#8217;d gone camping since about 1997, before I&#8217;d moved to Vancouver. Seven years is far too long a dry period.<br />
We weren&#8217;t camping alone, though. My aunt and uncle had invited us. This meant a good campsite (because Brenda would get up there long before us), good food (my family always cooks well, no matter where it is), and some really good insider knowledge of the Kananaskis area.<br />
Still, one had to be prepared. That meant going to Mountain Equipment Co-op for seam sealer (my tent had leaked the last time I&#8217;d used it) and two self-inflating mattresses so we wouldn&#8217;t be sleeping directly on the compacted gravel ground. (I still think I&#8217;m young, but even in my prime I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to sleep on that ground &#8212; it was like concrete.)<br />
Friday night, I picked up Alex and we headed west, stopping at the Safeway to get our basic food supplies. As we arrived at the store, we could see very dark, ominous clouds heading east. There was a storm approaching. A big one. A nasty one. One that was generating a lot of worry for a lot of people. Alex told me that a tornado watch was in effect.<br />
As we drove west, we started to pass under the storm. Big, heavy drops of rain fell periodically on the windshield. Not the little drops of a starting storm, but the elephantine plops of something wicked this way coming. Alex asked:<br />
&#8220;Um, just out of curiousity, how do you tell when a tornado is going to strike?&#8221;<br />
I thought about all the documentaries and articles that I&#8217;ve read about tornadoes. The general aspect was pretty simple:<br />
&#8220;When you see the worst weather you&#8217;ll ever see in your life.&#8221;<br />
We continued driving, the Mini skating a bit around on the highway. (It was quite windy.) The rain fell harder, the drops barely diminishing in size. Suddenly, going back to Calgary was seeming a better idea.<br />
Plink.<br />
Pling plack plink.<br />
[Insert sound of a million ball bearings bouncing of a tin roof.]<br />
Calgary is conveniently wedged in an area loosely known as &#8220;Hail Alley&#8221;, and for good reason. There&#8217;ve been a few nasty hailstorms here in the last decade or so. This was yet another one.<br />
Like every vehicle on the road, we pulled over. (If I&#8217;d been smart, I would have pulled alongside a transport truck, to shield myself from the deluge.) For the next 10 minutes, we were target practice for Mother Nature. The storm was wild, winds buffeting the little car (and its two occupants), pellets of ice rapping into the side as if to tear it apart (I honestly worried that we&#8217;d lose a window) and creating a 5-6 inch sheet of ice and water on the highway. It was so thick that we couldn&#8217;t see 10 metres away.<br />
The hail ranged from little pellets right up to near golf-ball size. The noise was deafening.<br />
Finally, the storm passed over (thankfully, storms out here don&#8217;t last too long), and we were able to start moving forward. It took a couple of kilometres driving barely over 20 km/h before the road cleared up enough for some forward movement. By the time we got to Scott Lake Hill, it was hard to tell that it had hailed. By the time we got on the highway into Kananaskis, you couldn&#8217;t even tell that foul weather had passed by.<br />
As the storm shrank in the distance (before pummelling south Calgary), Alex noted:<br />
&#8220;That was the worst weather I&#8217;d ever seen in my life.&#8221;<br />
(The result, in case you&#8217;re wondering, was hundreds of little dents on the roof, hood, and passenger side of the car, and a cracked driver&#8217;s side mirror. I&#8217;m taking this up with State Farm for repairs.)<br />
We finally arrived at site 17 of the Peter Lougheed Provincial Park&#8217;s Interlake campground just after 21:00. They were more than a little relieved to see us, since the campground manager had told them there was a tornado warning earlier in the day. (We would have no foul weather for the remainder of our time there.)<br />
We quickly pitched the tent and got ourselves settled. The managers (who zipped up and down on a golf cart) soon spotted the tent and let us know that we had to pay for the time we were there. By that point, we&#8217;d already been to the lake, started a fire, and chatted with Brenda and Jen about the drive out to the campground. (The managers were almost horrified at the story.)<br />
Brenda and Jen took off for the showers (the nearest ones are over a five minute drive away) while Alex and I enjoyed the setting sun and the lightning from distant storms illuminating the horizon over the mountains. We tried to roast marshmallows, but realized that we&#8217;d have to wait until they got back with the car. (The marshmallows were in the rear.)<br />
The two of us stayed up late, sitting on rocks on the shore of Lower Lake, watching the stars (we saw two satellites &#8212; the moving glint is hard to miss), and the massive thunderstorm way off to the south, which flashed light even through the trees (though you couldn&#8217;t hear a single rumble of thunder).<br />
We woke up late(ish) Friday morning. It looked earlier than it was, but since we were nestled well within the trees, it was hard to tell just how early (or late) it was. Almost as soon as we had waken, Alex turned to me, smiled, and said:<br />
&#8220;Happy birthday!&#8221;<br />
She would say this to me all day long. Have I mentioned that I love this woman?<br />
On Thursday, I&#8217;d had a little rant about how after waiting for four years for Critical Mass to finally have a Stampede breakfast, they decided to have one on the day I&#8217;d chosen to go camping. (It figured.) When Brenda offered pancakes as an option, I couldn&#8217;t resist. Alex whipped up the batter, and I tackled the bacon.<br />
So on my birthday, I still had my pancake breakfast. &#8216;Course, watch Critical Mass not do a Stampede breakfast next year.<br />
Following breakfast, Jen, Alex, and I went for a bike ride to fetch some milk. Jen, as you might recall, needs milk as badly as cars need gasoline (see [[Turning Japanese Again, Touring Osaka]]). Skim milk just wasn&#8217;t cutting it, so we biked to the store (near the showers) to pick up four litres of 2%. It would at least tide Jen over until later in the day. (Okay, yes, a bit of an exaggeration. But only a bit.)<br />
The ride there was a bit difficult, but not too hard. The trip back was considerably more difficult, as the hills were steeper. We arrived back to find a rope tied between two trees, brandishing a series of white balloons. The word had been spilled. Someone knew it was my birthday.<br />
(I have to admit that for quite a while, I thought Alex had something to do with all of this. She routinely denied anything beyond her own personal involvement, so I can only assume that my mom must&#8217;ve let her sister in on the deal.)<br />
The bike back had gotten us quite warm. (It didn&#8217;t help that it was already in the high 20s.) This seemed like as good a time as any to go swimming. And since our campsite was next to the &#8220;beach&#8221; (a very rocky beach), it seemed like a good idea. So armed with a couple of chairs and our books, we went in search of something a little cooler.<br />
Lower Lake is &#8230; cold. I won&#8217;t mince words, it&#8217;s numbing. It&#8217;s about 10 degree (an estimate, as I have no thermometer). Walking in was hard enough. Dunking was painful. By the time we got out, we could barely feel our knees. (We had to wear our flip-flops into the lake, due to the sharp rocks on the bottom.) Jen had even more trouble that we did.<br />
Sitting on the beach, we took in the sun, watching the people pass us by and the birds fly overhead. Using a pair of binoculars, I scanned the slopes of Mt. Indefatigable for signs of an illusive bear and her two cubs. They&#8217;re responsible for the mountain&#8217;s trails having been closed for the second year in a row. It&#8217;s not a good idea to climb a mountain with a mother grizzly bear.<br />
The search only garnered me a sunburn on my upper back. Ouch.<br />
Uncle Mike showed up not too long afterwards, with Maggie in tow. That meant it was time for lunch. We went with the old camping favourites: hamburgers and hotdogs. And some potato salad thrown in for good measure.<br />
After lunch, Mike and I hung the hammock. At that point, we officially lost Alex for the rest of the afternoon, as she wanted to spent the rest of her time swinging between the trees. I joined her before too long, and we drifted in and out of consciousness most of the afternoon. (We were supposed to go to Kananaskis Village with Mike and Jen, but they opted not to disturb us.)<br />
Dinner was later than usual, but given the late lunch and the heat, a break from eating wasn&#8217;t such a bad thing. Given the option of a side of beef and chicken, we went with the chicken. It was chicken served with a salad that had avocado and mango thrown in with the raspberry vinaigrette. Quite tasty, really.<br />
We also had dessert, which I&#8217;d half-hoped they wouldn&#8217;t do. (Of course, I half-hoped they would, so I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.) Out came Jen, carrying a birthday cake, riddled with candles. (I hopefully need not mention all the &#8220;old&#8221; jokes I got as we sat around the table. Don&#8217;t worry, Alex, you&#8217;ll get yours in due time.)<br />
Cheesecake. Sadly, not something I can usually eat. In fact, I&#8217;ve only ever been able to eat one cheesecake (one my friend Emma had made during the CBC 50th Anniversary Train journey). Fortunately, Mike and Jen had brought back some chocolate delicacies that would keep me placated.<br />
Following our meal, Alex and went for a short walk (primarily to the toilets, but we looped back via the beach). As we walked away from the campsite, we reached out to hold hands. But there was something in her palm. As I pulled my hand away to see what it was, she deposited the object into my palm. Keys. To her apartment. I think my heart actually stopped for a moment.<br />
Yes, folks, it&#8217;s that serious.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay up too late that night, as it was quite a bit cooler than the night before. Which is too bad, otherwise we might have heard more of the coyotes, who howled around the lakes all night.<br />
Waking around 10:00, we took immediately to the task of collapsing the tent. So long as the tent was down before 11:00, we wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about being charged for one more night. Breakfast soon followed &#8212; bacon and eggs, a classic if there ever was one.<br />
Following our meal, we headed up to Upper Lake, for a short hike to Rossland Creek. Or at least that was the idea. Unfortunately, Alex had a blister under her little toe, which subsequently burst, making walking exceptionally difficult. We made it about a kilometre or so, arriving at a large waterfall, before deciding to turn back.<br />
The idea was to head back towards Calgary, stopping at Calaway Park for the majority of the afternoon. Before leaving, we hit the showers at the Boulton campsite, to remove two day&#8217;s grime. Timed or not, that shower felt good.<br />
Arriving at Calaway Park about 90 minutes later, it was 32 degrees. It was stifling. But not nearly as stifling as the $23.54 entrance fee. Having neither enough money (or inclination), we decided that a Slurpee and Bowness Park was more than good enough. The remainder of the afternoon was spent in my backyard, where we read, drank a couple of beers, and cooked the last of our camping food &#8212; two hotdogs, and cobs of corn.<br />
So ended our camping weekend away. It&#8217;s a forgone conclusion that we will be doing this again. It&#8217;s just a matter of when and where.<br />
And preferably without the hail.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Calgary Stampede is up and running again. The kick-off was on Friday, with the much-anticipated Stampede parade. Naturally following the parade is another much-anticipated event in Calgary&#8230;<br />
The Stampede Breakfast.<br />
This has got to be one of the weirdest phenomenons I&#8217;ve ever experienced. Malls, business, even small communities all over the city sponsor free (or exceptionally inexpensive) pancake and sausage breakfasts. All you really need to do is show up and partake. Of course, that can also be part of the problem.<br />
Alex had wanted to try go to Westbrook Mall, not far from where she grew up. She had fond memories of the Stampede breakfasts there. Sadly, there was none to be found, so we were left with trying to get to Chinook before their breakfast was over. The route to get there was a little circuitous, which is not itself a problem, but it did take a little longer. Such as it is, though, we found a breakfast (apparently free, from what we could tell) in Garrison Woods. But we continued to Chinook nonetheless.<br />
The breakfast takes place in the south-east parking lot. And I mean the whole thing &#8212; from the road at the main entrance all the way down past the Chapters. It&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s huge. It&#8217;s actually listed in the Guiness Book of World Records as being the largest outdoor cooked breakfast. It&#8217;s a sea of people, with a flotilla of pancakes followed by a armada of sausages. And best of all &#8212; it&#8217;s free. In it&#8217;s 44th year, it still attracts droves of people.<br />
Food is sponsored by the stores of Chinook Mall, and its employees staff the grills. Alex and I got in the Sears line, which we would soon find out was either the fast cooking line, or the really lazy line because when we finally got to the food (after waiting about half an hour), there were no sausages to be found. And we could get anything from the other lines. There is a temptation to complain about this, but how can you when you didn&#8217;t pay for the meal in the first place?<br />
Sadly, the pancakes weren&#8217;t exactly outstanding, and the coffee seemed only fit for those with no taste (Alex would abandon hers to the ground, only to accidentally splash her feet with the concoction). We would supplement our meal with smoothies from Jugo Juice inside the mall, shortly before going on an underwear-buying spree.<br />
Yes, underwear. I needed some. So sue me.<br />
Realizing that we were officially running a little later than planned, we headed out to Bowness Park way out in the northwest, to attend a barbecue. This was the first annual Topmade Dragon Boat Club barbecue. The Topmade club has several teams, one of which is the DI-Hard team. (The &#8220;DI&#8221;, incidentally, means &#8220;Diagnostic Imaging&#8221;. Most of the people on the team, save for a few, work at Foothills Hospital as technicians. Those of us not working there are significant others.) The Topmade club is large, having about 130 members.<br />
Not all of them came out, unfortunately, but it was still interesting to see all the people that were on the other teams. We didn&#8217;t get a chance to mingle, though. We were there long enough to eat a couple hamburgers (more free food), listen to a speech, talk to a couple of people, and then we had to run off again.<br />
Yes, we were busy people on Saturday.<br />
This time, it was back to our respective homes for a change into clothes more suitable for a show and a dinner afterwards. The dinner? South African. The show? Cirque du Soleil&#8217;s &#8220;Quidam&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;ve seen Cirque du Soleil several times over the years, even from back in the day when they were just getting started. Today, they&#8217;re one of the most recognizable entertainment brands in the world. The last time I saw Cirque du Soleil was for Mystére in Las Vegas (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Touring Las Vegas and Cirque du Soleil Mystére]]). It was an amazing show to see, and I knew that Quidam wouldn&#8217;t disappoint.<br />
Cirque du Soleil requires a fair bit of space to set up all their equipment, and a tent of sufficient size for their stage and bleechers for the audience. The only space in Calgary good enough for this is the old Currie Barracks, currently being used for office space (as the Canadian Armed Forces no longer use the facility). This was where they set themselves up last year, too.<br />
We arrived running a little late, but managed to not miss anything with the show. We found our seats just in time for the ringmaster, John (one of the characters in Quidam) to start the show. The lights dimmed, to the point where you could not see your hand in front of your face. Despite being in a tent, the blockage of light was absolute.<br />
The show started with a bang, quite literally, as one character walked out into the middle of the round stage, and whacked his hands (wearing boxing gloves) over his head. The sharp crack and deep roll of thunder was accompanied by bursts of light high up in the canopy, and more darkness. And so began a little girl&#8217;s adventure from her boring life into the world of Quidam.<br />
That&#8217;s the general premise of the show &#8212; the girl&#8217;s adventure through a strange fantasy world. I don&#8217;t know how on Earth Cirque du Soleil comes up with their themes for the shows &#8212; but I&#8217;m glad they do. It&#8217;s a refreshing way of seeing entertainment in ways that many of us have seen before.<br />
The first act was the German Wheel. You&#8217;ve seen this before &#8212; a metal wheel, about seven feet in diameter, in which sits a sole performer who twists and turns not only himself, but the wheel&#8217;s motion. He was extremely adept with it, bringing the wheel almost to resting on the ground, only to push it back up (rolling around in circles) without ever touching the ground with his body. That kind of muscle control is exceptionally impressive. The fact that he did several acrobatic moves that I&#8217;ve never seen on a German Wheel before was also quite impressive.<br />
Next up were four little (assumedly) Chinese girls, who couldn&#8217;t have been more than 10 years old each. They displayed their talents with the diabolos &#8212; wooden spools slung on strings tied between sticks held in either hand. The strings are run back and forth to make the diabolo spin rapidly, allowing them to do a wide variety of tricks, usually involving throwing the diabolos high into the air. But there was also some rather impressive juggling, with rarely a beat missed.<br />
I say &#8220;rarely&#8221; because of one mistake. One of the girls stands still and flings her diabolo in the air. Another runs up, jumps up onto the shoulders of the first girl, and catches the diabolo on her string. The first time, she missed. But on the second attempt, she caught it. A rather impressive trick, in my opinion (and another reason why there is a live band &#8212; a pre-recorded soundtrack would not have allowed for a second attempt).<br />
Intermixed with the various performances were the ubiquitous clowns, who were quite good at making people laugh. They&#8217;re mimes, mostly, and do not look like the stereotypical circus clown. The first clown act drew a young woman out of the audience, who had to act along with the clown (they were all male) on the act of a first date. The poor woman did an excellent job playing along, despite the obvious embarrassment potential.<br />
The first half of the show continued with some interesting performances, including the Cloud Swing, Aerial Contortion in Silk (a woman hanging on a long sheet of silk), Aerial Hoops, and Spanish Webs. Intermission sent us out in search of some fresh air.<br />
That turned out to be not such a good idea, since our eyes had adjusted to the inside, and the sun had come out since we&#8217;d arrived. For me, it was blinding. I could barely see. For Alex, it was migraine-inducing. We didn&#8217;t spend much time outside before we went back in to take our seats.<br />
It was the right decision, since we were able to find Alex&#8217;s friends, Mandy and Oliver. We&#8217;d known they were coming to the show, but couldn&#8217;t find them in the melee during the break. Their seats were three rows away from ours, and we saw them when they came back. As we were meeting up for dinner afterwards, it was a good thing that we&#8217;d found them ahead of time.<br />
The show resumed with aplomb, subjecting us to the wonders of the Statue (a man and a woman who moved around each other in powerfully slow motions &#8212; they were so strong that he supported her upside down, her shoulders resting on his, and able to slowly stand and kneel without her falling off), the Banquine (acrobats who could do the most amazing stunts without the use of a trampoline or safety wires), and Skipping Ropes (boring-sounding, I know, but you&#8217;ve never seen a pentagonal jumping rope before, I&#8217;ll bet).<br />
The show ended with three curtain calls. The cast was about 40 people or so, but that&#8217;s a guess since I wasn&#8217;t able to count them all. That includes musicians, by the way. The lights came on, and we headed out to try and not be blinded outdoors.<br />
We headed down to 17th Ave., where we met up with Mandy and Oliver at Jabulani, a South African restaurant. (Mandy and Oliver are South African, hence the reason we went.) It&#8217;s been around for a year, and seems to have some sort of regular customers (Mandy and Oliver were recognized by the staff).<br />
The cuisine of South Africa, not completely represented at Jabulani, isn&#8217;t much different than what you&#8217;d find at some of the Western restaurants in Calgary. But it&#8217;s closer to authentic South African. You&#8217;ll find the obvious Dutch and British influences, but also Indian (which I found a bit of a surprise). For example, I had oxtail stew, Oliver had curried lamb, and Alex had &#8220;pork chops&#8221; (they were more like slabs of ham). I can&#8217;t remember what Mandy had.<br />
The meals were excellent. We had South African (soda) pop to go along with our repast. I had Schweppes Dry Lemon, which is basically tonic water with lemon in it. (I was parched from the dry air in the tent, so drank my first Dry Lemon quite rapidly.) Many and Oliver had Grapetisers, which is more or less carbonated grape juice.<br />
Dessert was an experience, indeed. I had something called &#8220;koeksisters&#8221;, which are braided dough, sort of like a tough donut, which you dip into slightly-sweetened whipping cream. The dough is soaked in syrup, so it quite tasty (but not sticky). Mandy had banana samosas. Alex went with roiboos ice cream.<br />
We stayed until almost 22:00, when we finally headed off in our separate directions. But Alex and I didn&#8217;t go home just yet &#8212; we went to check out the fireworks display at the Stampede from Scotchman&#8217;s Bluff, which overlooks the Stampede grounds. It&#8217;s a popular location &#8212; the hillside was already well covered with watchers by the time we arrived.<br />
Bed didn&#8217;t arrived until after midnight. &#8220;Exhausted&#8221; doesn&#8217;t quite cut the feeling of drained. But it was a good exhausted, as it had been a great day. I felt sorry for Alex, who had to work the following morning. I almost feel guilty because I got to sleep in.<br />
Almost&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Saturday started with the *hope* of going out to Elbow Falls to try and do some hiking. Notice that I used the word &#8220;hope&#8221;. Hope turned to not, with the realization that the weather wasn&#8217;t likely to cooperate with us.<br />
We slept in a bit.<br />
After packing in some breakfast, Alex and I went out to do something fun. Specifically, mini-golf at the Golf Centre at Harvest Hills. This appears to be a relatively new construction, or at least the mini-golf course is &#8212; the driving range might have been there a while already (I honestly can&#8217;t remember).<br />
The course is a little more playful than most, but lacks some of the really wacky aspects that some mini-golf courses have. (I say &#8220;lacks&#8221; because, in all honestly, the really bizarre courses are often the most fun.) The course was still damp from previous rainfalls, which provided a few interesting obstacles &#8212; namely, wet feet and a bit of slopping when the balls hit a wet patch.<br />
Most of the holes weren&#8217;t a particular challenge, but that didn&#8217;t stop either of us from hitting some bad shots. We redid two holes, partly because the holes were fun and partly to improve our abysmal scores. (There was also no-one behind us.) In the end, Alex beat me, although I&#8217;m not sure by how much. We kept score, but not really&#8230;<br />
I realized after a couple of holes that Alex could probably whip my keister in mini-golf, if given half the chance. However, a competitive streak in me was coming out &#8212; a bit of a sour one, at that. (I&#8217;m usually self-deprecating, but it&#8217;s a fine line from making fun of your lack of skill, to appearing to be a sore loser.) While she mentioned nothing, and I didn&#8217;t ask if she had noticed and started to play differently as a result, I felt it wise to smarten up a bit.<br />
Putting over, we decided to give the driving a chance. While I had a few really good hits, I was woefully out of practice. I hooked a lot too, seemingly drawn to a parked cherry picker off to the left. I cleared a few over the extra-tall fence. The grips made mince meat of my left palm &#8212; not sure if my grip was off or if its affirmation that I need a glove on that hand. Either way, I need more practice.<br />
The experience on the rather damp mini-golf course made me finally decide that I *had* to get new sandals. (That, and Alex&#8217;s hinting that the smell could be construed as a biological weapon under some treaties.) Lest you think that I&#8217;m being extravagant with my footwear, you need to understand something first&#8230;<br />
I loved my sandals. They were Teva Univerals, purchased from Europe Bound on Front Street in Toronto seven years ago. Seven years I wore them. I wore those sandals as much as I could. When I lived in Vancouver, I had thought about replacing them &#8212; they were getting a little worn (and that was only after about three-ish years). I didn&#8217;t put much effort into it, though, and let it slide &#8230; for over four more years. As of Saturday morning, the insole was reduced to the glue used to hold the insole to the rest of the sandal with the remaining insole cracked and splitting, the velcro barely held, the sole was worn through to the straps and foam rubber insides, and the aforementioned smell was &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just be glad that you can&#8217;t smell things through the Internet.<br />
For the record, I&#8217;ve been actively looking since sandal weather finally hit Calgary this year (took a while longer than usual). Problem: finding sandals that I a) liked, and b) fit. What I wanted was another pair of Teva Universals. Problem? Nary a place in Alberta seems to sell them! I hunted through every store I could find. Nothing. Nada. The closest I came was a pair of the women&#8217;s version at Abominable Sports in Banff (Bamf!). But no men&#8217;s. Anywhere.<br />
It came to pass that we went to Sunridge, where there was rumoured to be leather Tevas. Sadly, I was thwarted yet *again*. However, in the midst of my disappointment, came across a pair of Clarks. Well, my feet haven&#8217;t been so happy. I feel a certain amount of sadness for putting my beloved Tevas to one side, but for the sheer joy of walking in sandals without the squishing, flapping of unbound straps, or the near-unbearable stench, there can be little argument that I&#8217;ve done well.<br />
Just to make sure the sandals were right, we walked around the mall a bit. The walk was good to break in the feet. Even when we stood in the Sanrio store for about 45 minutes while Alex had a serious relapse to her childhood (not that I&#8217;m complaining &#8212; I&#8217;ve had similar problems). It&#8217;s safe to say that should we end up with kids, we will have a Hello Kitty room somewhere in the house.<br />
The big debate will be who gets to spend time in the room &#8212; the children, or mom.<br />
We left the mall into the dark clouds of a passed storm. I had thought I&#8217;d heard rain while we were inside, but it was hard to tell. The wet ground, however, was a bit of a give-away.<br />
A note on that rain, incidentally. There are a lot of people who wonder if we&#8217;ve somehow been transported to the West Coast. The weather here is more typical of Vancouver, not the fringe of the prairies. It&#8217;s quite odd, and annoying for some. We haven&#8217;t had the really warm weather normally associated with this time of year. Instead, we&#8217;ve had rain almost every day (even if just a sprinkle) for a month! We should be entering our dry season, seeing brown grasses, not witnessing torrential downpours every few days.<br />
While Alex went off for tea with her friend Erin, I set about the task of making dinner. It took me longer than planned (owing to a minor issue in preparation), which was just in time for Alex to arrive and start making cupcakes. (We went to my relatives&#8217; home Sunday night, and we were bringing dessert. But more on that in a minute.)<br />
Betty Crocker? Ha! Safeway brand? Puh-leaze! Alex made &#8217;em from scratch. Including the icing! (And darn tasty, too, I might add!) I got to be the official taste-tester. I need to do more baking to get the feel for it. I can handle sauces, entrees, soups, stews, barbecues, even a few desserts. Ask me to bake a cake and I&#8217;ll give you a blank stare. Wouldn&#8217;t even know where to start. Not a one. One day, though. One day.<br />
Sunday we tried to get up early again. The weather, yet again, conspired against us. In lieu of a picnic and hike at Elbow Falls, we opted for a hike at Fish Creek Park and a picnic at Starbucks (or other widely-available similarly-branded store selling things not particularly good for one&#8217;s dietary needs).<br />
Finding the entrance to the section of park we wanted to go into wasn&#8217;t easy. The signs are, well, mostly non-existant. On the bright side, we explored some of the newer subdivisions in the south-west corner of the city. Yet more reasons why I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever want to live that far out. (As Alex so eloquently put it, anything with five digits on the house number is too far away.) It feels like suburban hell out there.<br />
When we finally found the park, we saw signs that bears had also apparently found the park. We never saw any, except on the signs the City of Calgary Parks Department had left up to let park patrons be aware. Considering that we covered a good portion of the park west of MacLeod Trail, it might be safe to assume that the bear(s) prefered to either stay hidden, or leave altogether.<br />
Damp (due to continued precipitation in various strengths and quantities) and hungry, we headed over to South Centre Mall for a quick repast (careful to keep it light for the upcoming family dinner that night). Yogen Fruz. Not the most substantial of snacks, but a load healthier than the bulk of the crap for sale in the food court. We wandered the mall, eating our small frozen vanilla yogurt mixed with fruit, seeing what there was to see.<br />
We stopped in a few stores, but the only one of real consequence was the Charm Diamond Centre, where we looked at rings.<br />
Whoo&#8230; I can see the wide-eyed stares of disbelief and panic from here!<br />
Relax, we&#8217;re not engaged and we&#8217;re not getting married any time soon. We went to look. No other reason (for now) than to view a piece of jewellry. In fact, it was a specific style that Alex had seen before that drew us in there. They didn&#8217;t have it available, though, so I don&#8217;t really know what it looks like (hence, cannot describe it to you). There was an illuminated poster, but the colours were rather washed out.<br />
With that, it was time to head up to Mike and Brenda&#8217;s for dinner. The first meeting of the family is always a bit nerve-wracking, no matter how many times you&#8217;ve done it before or how confident you think you are. Families are always different. My turn will come later this summer.<br />
It was a night of digging. Some digging was about Alex (though not too deeply) and some digs were at each other. Uncle Mike, unfortunately, caught a few too many (some from me, and I went a little too deep on a couple &#8212; sorry, Mike) when the subject of the missing cupboard doors came up. They&#8217;ve been off so long that I don&#8217;t even notice the lack of them anymore.<br />
Dinner was wonderful &#8212; crab cake appetizers, roast beef, freshly roasted BC potatoes, two kinds of salads, and the weirdest bread I&#8217;d ever had. Of course, we had cupcakes for dessert. All the ones we brought were eaten. Three by Jen, alone! (Needless to say, Alex is welcome back.)<br />
So yes, if you&#8217;re wondering, things are going exceptionally well for us. I can&#8217;t imagine them going any better. They will, of course, but I can&#8217;t imagine what that&#8217;ll be like. I haven&#8217;t been this happy in a relationship &#8230; well, ever, really. They say that the person you&#8217;re best with is the person who is like your best friend. And that was exactly the premise that had sent me in search of a partner in the first place.<br />
Funny how life works sometimes, ain&#8217;t it?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Our fair country has been around for 137 years, now, and it doesn&#8217;t look a day over 100 &#8212; we&#8217;ve still got all the problems we did back in &#8217;67.<br />
Alex and I had a fairly action-packed day. We started off with a jaunt over to Booster Juice to get ourselves a snack to get the day started. Why there? Well, a smoothie goes over pretty well right before you do a run.<br />
Yes, run. (If you have missed a few of these, either by living under a rock or scanning them like I know some of you do, I have taken to running for exercise.) This was for the P.A.R.T.Y. program, run through Foothills Hospital. It means &#8220;Prevent Alcohol and Risk Related Trauma in Youth&#8221;. (Yeah, it should be P.A.R.R.T.Y., but then it could be construed to sound like the mating cry of a frat house member.)<br />
Simply put, it&#8217;s a &#8220;scared-straight&#8221; method. Take a bunch of teens, and run them through the trauma bay at the hospital. Show them what&#8217;ll happen if they drink and drive. Show them the injuries, the equipment that would be used, and the procedures they&#8217;d have to go through. Some of them get sick, at least one almost always faints. I don&#8217;t know if it always gets the point across, but I&#8217;m sure that the program must reduce the number of teens injured in DUI accidents.<br />
The race is to raise awareness and money for the program. Fees are $35, which includes the administration of the race, t-shirts, food (though that might be donated), with the rest going to the program. It&#8217;s a 5 km walk/run or a 10 km run, depending on what you want to do. We did the 5 km version. We weren&#8217;t exactly the fastest ones out there.<br />
We were beaten by a one-legged man and a woman carrying two babies.<br />
(Okay, yes, we walked. It was more for helping the program.)<br />
Following the &#8220;race&#8221;, we headed out of town to Banff (Bamf!). The day was starting off to be beautiful, and we hoped it would stay that way long enough for us to enjoy the weather. For the most part, it was great! Right until we passed the 1X interchange near Exshaw. That was when we hit traffic.<br />
Lots of traffic.<br />
About 90 minutes of traffic.<br />
Ninety minutes that would normally take about 10 minutes in regular traffic conditions.<br />
Why was it so bad? They&#8217;re doing bridge reconstruction on the Trans-Canada Highway not far from Deadman&#8217;s Flats. The highway is reduced to two lanes and a speed limit of 50 km/h. Normally, this doesn&#8217;t affect traffic too much. But this is a long weekend (well, it is for some people), which means that most of Calgary goes into the mountains.<br />
Would it *really* have hurt whatever level of government agency that is responsible for this project to put up signs warning of heavy traffic, and suggest alternate routes like the 1A? Y&#8217;know, I&#8217;m thinking that maybe the government might want to think about that for the next long weekend that comes up (or possibly every weekend, now that the weather is outstanding) so people can avoid that kind of traffic. (That would be a subtle hint for any of you government-types listening out there.)<br />
Arriving at the east-end Banff off-ramp, we turned north instead of south, and went to Lake Minnewanka. I&#8217;d only been there once before (see [[Banff National Park and Lake Minnewanka]]), during some very nice weather. Yesterday, sadly, wasn&#8217;t great. Clouds had rolled in as we had started to leave Calgary, and had splashed rain on us at Canmore. We would be rained on several times yet before the day was through, and usually while we were outside, away from the car.<br />
We walked past the boat launch at the south end of Minnewanka, and up to a rocky shoreline. There, we found a place on the &#8220;beach&#8221; to just look around at the beauty of the area. It drizzled a little, not enough to chase us away.<br />
From there, we drove over to Lake Johnson, where we had the chance to wander a bit in the forest. A plethora of mosquitoes eventually chased us back out, and we headed into Banff (Bamf!) townsite.<br />
For the first time since I can&#8217;t remember when, we couldn&#8217;t get a parking spot in the free lot. Yes, I know it was Canada Day, but even the last time (see [[Visiting Bragg Creek and Elbow Falls, Canada Day in Banff (Bamf!)]]), we got parking there. We ended up circling the side streets before finding a nice spot, and headed for a late lunch/early dinner at Bruno&#8217;s Diner.<br />
When we exited, we found that Banff Ave. had effectively been closed down. It was a parade, of all things! I&#8217;d never seen a Canada Day parade before, so it was a bit novel. Even more so that it was in a small town, meaning it was going to be a small one. Still, there was room for the Shiners (a necessity at any parade), a couple of floats (including one for the Calgary Stampede, which starts next Friday), two or three marching bands, a fire truck, a Snocoach from the Columbia Icefields, and the 10th Brigade pipe and drum band.<br />
Parade over, we walked down more side streets until we found our way to the Bow River, where we sat for a while, eating our Turtles fudge. That&#8217;s about when the rain hit again. We took cover under some conifers, waiting for the rain to pass enough that we could walk back to Banff Ave. without getting soaked.<br />
We took the opportunity to into a couple of stores and view wares for sale. Alex bought a rather nice toe ring, and I bought a book called &#8220;Why I Hate Canadians&#8221;, by Will Ferguson. (It&#8217;s a rather interesting book about a Canadian returning home after several years abroad. He goes after the sacred cows and reminds us that while we think we&#8217;re the best thing since sliced bread, we&#8217;re not as special as we think we are.) Alex read it aloud to me as we drove back to Calgary.<br />
And as should be done by every Canadian who can, we went to see fireworks last night. The best show in town is at Canada Olympic Park. We didn&#8217;t opt to go all the way out there, since the traffic back would be simply ridiculous. So we opted to hike up the side of Nose Hill to get a good view. In theory, it was a splendid idea. In reality, well&#8230;<br />
Nose Hill is a great place for a hike. During the day. At night, it&#8217;s difficult to see, so you run risk tripping over large rocks. Also, you have deliriously stupid teenagers who feel the need to shriek like idiots the whole time (I swear I got 40 years older last night), nearly drowning out the faint booms of pyrotechnics exploding several kilometres away.<br />
And then there&#8217;s the mosquitoes. With all the rain we&#8217;ve been having, there&#8217;s a lot of &#8217;em this year.<br />
All in all, it was a wonderful Canada Day. And a busy one. Sadly, I had to come in to work today (not having the foresight to take it off), so was a little out of it for most of the day. Next year, though, I&#8217;m going to enjoy it more, and make a nice, long weekend out of it.<br />
With Alex, of course.<br />

		<p>This weekend was a bit of a surprise. Not that it suddenly appeared from out of nowhere, but that until something happened, I had no idea what was yet to come.<br />
The weekend started with the one thing I did have control over: a barbecue. Specifically, the first Jerks BBQ of the summer. What is a &#8220;Jerks BBQ&#8221;, you might ask? The group of people that I work with most around the office are The Jerks. Effectively, we&#8217;re mostly web developers. Why &#8220;Jerks&#8221;? Well, we have a rather odd term of endearment around here: &#8220;JERK!&#8221;. Hence, we&#8217;re Jerks.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s 23:00 Sunday night, and this is the first time in four days that I&#8217;ve had a chance to be alone with my computer.<br />
Not that I&#8217;m necessarily complaining, I might add.<br />
The last four days have been a mad combination of work-related mayhem, drunken debauchery (see: work-related mayhem), and spending time with Alex. All of it has been great fun, which is why I need two entries to cover it all. But first, the work-related mayhem and drunken debauchery &#8230; more or less in that order.<br />
Every six months, Critical Mass holds a Town Hall. It&#8217;s a gathering of everyone in the company, remote offices included, to listen to information the company wishes to disseminate in a semi-public forum. The Town Halls held in January are mostly business. Numbers, facts, trends&#8230; you usually need several strong coffees to get you through them. But the ones in June are a special breed &#8212; it&#8217;s more of a show than real information. It&#8217;s almost an excuse to leave the office and watch a bunch of people entertain the rest of us, gain a bit more information than we already did, and then go drinking.<br />
At least, that&#8217;s what this one was like.<br />
We gathered at the Vertigo Theatre, in the basement of the Calgary Tower complex downtown, not far from the office. This apparently used to be an old movie theatre, now converted into fairly nice stage theatres. When we arrived in the lobby, we were split into small groups (for what reason, I wasn&#8217;t initially certain. When our group was called, we walked over to the theatre door, but were thrown up against the wall, and subjected to what I can only describe as a severe infraction of the Geneva Convention. We had to sing The Village People&#8217;s &#8220;Macho Man&#8221;.<br />
This was courtesy of Dan, my business unit&#8217;s Managing Director. He was strung out on something (either far too much caffeine, or something far more exotic), wearing a microphone of a style made famous by Garth Brooks, and yelling like he was on TV. Apparently, so were we. As Phillipe filmed, we were made to cheer, laugh, heckle, and boo. Then came the song. We were quite puzzled, to say the least. It came quite clear when we entered the theatre, only to find the next group after us being subjected to the same humilation &#8212; broadcast onto a large screen on the stage.<br />
Once everyone had been put through the wringer and the auditorium was full, we began the show. Dan walked out on stage, still wearing the mike, announcing that he was the stage manager of this freak show, and it was time to get it going. So with no further adieu, he welcome onstage the announcer, the man with the best radio voice in the company, Scott. Naturally, this precipitated a loud cheer from those of us who work with him. Scott then took over, bringing on the musical host of this wacky production, which was to no-one&#8217;s surprise, our sound engineer, Dewi. And then came the host, the man who puts the &#8220;I&#8221; in &#8220;loser&#8221; (bit of an in-joke, due to his last name), my *boss*, Allard.<br />
*That* suprised me. No, actually, that *stunned* me. I simply did not see that coming. But the fact that he was hosting the little deal was nothing compared with the fact that he was not only good at what he did, he was *amazing*. As I would find out later, almost none of Allard&#8217;s material was scripted (at least so that he had to remember it). He either only had vague directions leading to some dialogue, or completely adlibbed. His opening monologue was actually very funny. He even caught our CEO, Jerry, completely off-guard by calling him by his initials: JJ &#8230; and JK, JL, JM, J-Lo. (Jerry&#8217;s reactions to Allard&#8217;s off-the-cuff comments were almost as entertaining as the comments.)<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;ve challenged Allard to keep this up for our meetings. He&#8217;ll make them a lot more interesting.<br />
Several videos peppered the skits that the group put on. The group included the five previously mentioned, Thelton, Dave, Carl (who did a great job presenting the true direction of the company), two Peters, Simone, Robb, Chrissie, Ed, Jason, Arif (a mainstay of all our Town Halls), and &#8220;guest appearances&#8221; by Cory, Colin, and the infamous rubber chicken. While the chicken incident kind of bombed (the joke was a little abused as of late), the videos had people rolling in many cases.<br />
The bulk of the actual business information came from the rather lengthy Q&amp;A session with Thelton and Jerry, kicked off by the question that all inquiring minds wanted to know: Boxers or briefs? While Thelton and JZ were hoping to avoid some of the more numbers-related questions, they invariably arose (hard not to, I guess). But they were all answered. And we ended the session early.<br />
Early enough for the aforementioned debauchery.<br />
This year, we ended up at the Whiskey. They weren&#8217;t ready for us when we arrived, and the poor bartender upstairs had to run around frantically to get ready. We got there about an hour ahead of time. But frankly, that&#8217;s not an excuse. The inside of the Whiskey was dead. Can you expect me to believe that they couldn&#8217;t have had the upstairs ready in time? Not swift, if you ask me. But soon enough, we were getting loaded, and that&#8217;s all that really matters.<br />
A water gun made an appearance, weilded by Thelton. (You got to love a President who&#8217;s willing to be as immature as the rest of us.) Adrian tackled him to get it away and hose down others. I got wet on a few occassions, but didn&#8217;t care so long as the camera stayed dry.<br />
Before I knew it, the sun was setting, and a group of us were heading over to the Bear and Kilt to continue festivities. The antics, including spilled beers (on the pool table, so I gather &#8212; that wasn&#8217;t me, incidentally), spilled french fries and beef dip sauce (that was me), and probably more than a few spilled secrets (don&#8217;t know if that was me or not &#8212; I was very drunk by then) flowed about. By after 1:00, it was time to go home.<br />
Mark, Amy, and I wandered down 4th St. to take Amy home. Mark headed off at 17th Ave., with the two of us continuing south. Amy offered to put me up at her place overnight, but I needed to get home for my cameras for the following morning. Despite two stops for hangover prevention, I woke up with a killer headache.<br />
Just in time for the Kananaskis Cowpunch.<br />
&#8220;What on Earth is that?&#8221; you might be asking. This is the name for this year&#8217;s company summer event. Arriving at the office (holding my head and liberally drinking a bottle of Gatorade), we waited for the signal to board our buses and head out to the Rafter 6 Ranch, not far from Exshaw. There, we would engage in activities that would have nothing to do with our daily job. This included golf (nine holes), white water rafting, horseback riding (western-style), yoga, hiking, or canoeing. Me? I chose to do nothing, and take pictures instead.<br />
Why? Well, I don&#8217;t have my own clubs, and I play cross-country golf. (I&#8217;m pretty bad.) I&#8217;ve done white water rafting on the Kicking Horse River three times &#8212; the Kananaskis River just ain&#8217;t gonna cut it. I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of horses, so riding was out. As for yoga, while I do love it, I&#8217;m very partial to my yoga instructor, Lori, and wasn&#8217;t really in the mood for someone different. Hiking didn&#8217;t sound interesting at first, though I found out later that I probably wouldn&#8217;t have minded it. As for canoeing, it was in a 12-person canoe. That&#8217;s a dragonboat to me, which is not really quite what I had in mind for relaxing.<br />
Besides, *someone* needs to take the pictures.<br />
The weather in Calgary and area as of late resembled that of Vancouver &#8212; wet and miserable. Cyndy, our office manager and the one who organized most of this, was unbelievably relieved to see that the weather had panned out. She swore that things weren&#8217;t going to work out. But the sun was out, the weather was warm, and clouds were few and far between. Almost as soon as we arrived at the Ranch (the golfers went direct to the course), the groups went off to get ready.<br />
I wandered down to where the horse riders were gathered to hop on their mounts. The horses were not the happiest animals I&#8217;ve ever seen. They&#8217;re either extremely well-trained, or (and I hate to suggest it) abused. They didn&#8217;t move very much, and didn&#8217;t seem particularly energetic. As I don&#8217;t know horse behaviour that well, I can only assume (and hope) that Rafter 6 Ranch follows proper animal treatment guidelines.<br />
Over at the rafting shed, the majority of the CM group was getting their waivers sorted out (which apparently contained some clause about bears, of all things) and preparing to get their equipment to head out. I really wanted to get photos of the rafters on the water, but as I had no idea where they were setting in (it wasn&#8217;t at the Ranch), I had to settle for some group shots pre-wetsuits.<br />
I passed back and forth between the horse riders (it took a while to get them all on horseback) and the rafters (it took a while to get them all in rubber) until both groups had headed off. Luke, the largest person in the rafting group, looked about the most uncomfortable in his wetsuit. I so desperately wanted a picture of him in his neoprene skin, but he wisely declined.<br />
The horses were mostly watching people who have either never ridden a horse, or looked very uncomfortable on a horse, waiting around for the rest of the group (there would be two waves) to get their horse. Some people were fairly even with their steeds, and aside from a bit of uneasiness, were ready to ride. Some, like Jamie, looked like they&#8217;d never been on a horse before (Jamie actually said: &#8220;How does this thing work?&#8221; &#8212; it was hard to tell if he was serious or not).<br />
Then there was Garth. Garth is our DBA Manager. Garth seemed to really know what he was doing. I even commented on it.<br />
Me: Garth, you sound like an old ranch hand!<br />
Garth: I am.<br />
Figures I&#8217;d meet a DBA Manager who grew up on a farm south of Edmonton, who rode horses for the better part of a decade.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that there weren&#8217;t a couple of problems. Terri&#8217;s horse suddenly decided to not want to cooperate and reared up. Terri, fearing a bucking, grabbed the reins to keep from falling off. Sadly, not the correct course of action, as pulling back on the reins only makes the horse rear more. It took a few quick commands from the handlers to keep Terri from falling off.<br />
Horses off and rafters away, I wandered back up to our portion of the ranch to hang out for the next couple of hours. There, I found Cyndy and Lindsay, who had beers in hand. It appeared the bar was officially open.<br />
And everyone else thought I was missing out on activities&#8230;<br />
We chatted a while, admiring the surrounding area. The Rafter 6 is located in a wonderful little pocket of Kananaskis, within spitting distance of the mountains without actually being in them. And far enough away from the highway that you can&#8217;t hear it. Just the wind, the birds, the odd nickering of a horse, wind through the trees, and the river (once you get close enough to it, anyway).<br />
The Ranch is about 200 years old, so I&#8217;m told. It&#8217;s also massive, though I suspect much of the land has either been turned into random pasture land (instead of the need for huge expanses for cattle) with some turned over to other interests (there&#8217;s a YMCA camp &#8220;next door&#8221;, which I imagine was once part of the ranch itself). But there&#8217;s still ample room to wander around. The grounds have several buildings, including the hotel, dining hall, barn, several cabins, and the chapel (which was where the yoginis practiced their moves &#8212; quite a beautiful sight from where we were).<br />
Lindsay and I decided to go off on a short walk to find the others in our &#8220;do nothing&#8221; group. We headed down to the river (we understood that Pavel had brought a fishing rod), babbling the whole way there and back. We never found the rest of the group, but did have a nice walk, nonetheless.<br />
Lunch was not far off when we got back, which was about the time that the hikers, horse riders, and rafter returned. Yoga had finished, the participants changed and lounging around. Slowly, but surely, the group was regathering. Cyndy and I went out to meet the horse riders as they trotted through. Cyndy was having far too much fun with everyone else, and commented that they&#8217;d all be walking bow-legged for a while. Someone commented about needing a rub-down &#8230; then Harjinder commented about needing some Vaseline. I nearly dropped the camera from laughing so hard.<br />
Lunch was hamburgers, chicken, vegetable shishkebabs, baked beans, and salads. Following what most of us considered to be normal buffet behaviour, we grabbed two hamburger buns and got in line. One burger each. Fine, we&#8217;ll just come back later. Apparently, Rafter 6 had only enough buns so that we&#8217;d have *one* burger each. One. Just one. Uh, hello? It&#8217;s a barbecue. No-one has just *one*. Sliced bread had to come out for everyone else. The golfers finally showed up as the first round of lunch was wrapping up.<br />
After lunch, we had completely unstructure free time. This led Luke, Torin, and myself to go way out into the fields and throw around Luke&#8217;s aerobee (basically, a flying ring, as opposed to the standard Frisbee). My aim was way off for the first little while, and I made Luke and Torin run a bit. I eventually grew tired of the activity, and resumed photography.<br />
I was waiting for the &#8220;surprise&#8221;. At 14:30, we were told to head down to the rodeo corral for the remainder of the afternoon. This was for a rodeo, though not with any animals other than horses. This was a volunteer rodeo, where various members of the staff would hop on a horse and make a horse&#8217;s ass of themselves. Which, of course, is the point.<br />
More food would await us. As I approached the rodeo corral, I saw a large group of people milling around something, then walking off with &#8230; ICE CREAM! Changing my direction, I went in direction of something cold and yummy. I had thought the vessel holding the cool treats was a freezer of some kind. But we were on a ranch &#8212; the ice cream was contained in soft-sided insulated bags, slung over the back of a miniature horse. It was very cute, although the little guy REALLY hated the bags, and didn&#8217;t really appreciate 200 somewhat drunk people surrounding it.<br />
The rodeo was quite simple: a corral, six horses, and a few interesting games. First up was Musical Horses. Similar to musical chairs, the idea is to walk your horse around a ring of tires. When the music stops, you jump down and put one foot in the tire. The rest is pretty self-explanatory. Then there was the egg race, which is a lap around the corral holding an egg on a spoon. Following that was a race where two people (on different horses) had to hold a piece of plastic tape between them. First ones across the finish line still holding the tape between them won. Then came the barrel race, a rodeo mainstay, involving a little more horsemanship to get around all the barrels. A bizarre relay race came afterwards, involving two riders per horse and a few transgender clothing swaps. The final race was the favourite: the beer race. That&#8217;s when six riders run to the other end, chug a beer (you have to turn it upside down over your head to prove you&#8217;ve finished), then race back.<br />
Musical horses was quite funny. Dan got stuck with the smallest horse, which he seemed rather proud about. Dan was quite adept with his little horse, out-maneuvering several others, only to finally be defeated because his horse wanted to grandstand instead of co-operate. The music, incidentally, was the rest of us singing &#8220;100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall&#8221;, which went something like this:<br />
&#8220;100 bottles of beer on the wall, 100 bottles of beer, [incoherent mumbling following the tune of the song], 99 bottles of beer on the wall&#8230;&#8221; and so on.<br />
Partway through the rodeo, I opted to go get another ice cream. It was hot, and they&#8217;re tasty. And that&#8217;s all the excuse I need, darn it! When I got out there, the wee little horsie wasn&#8217;t in much better of a mood than when I&#8217;d first come across him. In fact, as I attempted to get my ice cream bar, the little bugger got out of his bridle, and started to pull away. His handler tried to hang onto him, but only got one of the refrigerator bags off instead. Released of the grip, he was off like a shot, tearing away at a rate you couldn&#8217;t have convinced me a little thing like that could do! He even kept up with the bigger horses. One of the ranch hands took off after him with a lasso. Had my hands not been full, I would have been able to get the whole event on video.<br />
The egg race was a little dull, other than all the fallen eggs, of course. The tape race was only amusing insofar as watching Evelyn and Jamie try to stay on their horses and still hang onto the tape. Jamie&#8217;s prowess with a horse is &#8230; well, nigh non-existant, so he was having difficulties staying with Evelyn. The barrel race was a bit of a heart-stopper when Marcie fell off when her horse came to a dead halt as it prepared to go around the last barrel. Thankfully, she was alright. Moments later, the same thing nearly happened to the next person, but recovered in time. The clothes race was something to watch, if only to see Jerry in a frilly woman&#8217;s bathing suit.<br />
The beer race was the contentious one. It came down to two key competitors: Bill and Chris. On the first race, Bill won but was called out for supposedly not drinking all of his beer (on video replay, there was a bit too much landing on his hat). Chris, reported to be the fasted guzzle in the west, probably felt a bit cheated. So there was a rematch, pitting the two (and Lindsay, who came in third) to resolve the issue. This time, Chris raced to success, with Bill a little more drunk for wear.<br />
The rodeo over, we all headed back to the dining area to relax until the busses were called &#8212; not long afterwards. By this point, I was resembling a lobster (or rather, I was told I was; in reality I wasn&#8217;t nearly that bad), and felt it wise to head out on the first wave of busses. However, I should have waited for the fourth and final bus.<br />
Those who did engaged in what I could only imagine to be the wildest bus party the company has ever seen. Cyndy was so loopy, she was tossing clothing out the window as it went down the road (I have no idea whose it was). Waterguns were soaking everything in sight. Thelton decided to try and sneak up on Shawn, our Account Director in Austin, crawling along the aisle floor on all fours. Shawn, however, saw Thelton coming, crawled over two rows of chairs to empty his beer onto Thelton&#8217;s head. A pit stop at a Petro-Canada set off a round of stickering (mostly on people) and a run on beef jerky. Somewhere along the line, Cyndy declared something about &#8220;getting nekkid&#8221; and swapped shirts with Jim.<br />
*Sigh* I miss all the fun.<br />
We were to head to Coyotes after arriving back at Critical Mass. There we engaged in more games of &#8220;see how many drink tickets we can get from Thelton&#8221;, among babbling with each other. Staying at Coyotes was not an option, however. Coyotes is not really my first choice for a good bar to go to &#8230; actually, it would be my *last* choice, along with Cowboys and Tantra (formerly The Drink). Such as it was, however, the beer was free, and that was reason enough.<br />
Luke, Allison, James, Torin, Scott, Natalia, Wendy, Alain, Gary, and myself vacated (long before the Miss Corona pageant was to start, thankfully) and went to Sumo over in Eau Claire Market. There we gorged ourselves on Japanese (mostly sushi) and swapped stories about the day. As the sun slowly set, a chill came over. About 30 minutes before we left, Torin barked out &#8220;Hey Jerks!&#8221; to someone passing by the patio we were on. It was Jerry, Scott (from Chicago) and Shawn. Jerry whipped around to see who had insulted him. Seeing it was just us, he barked back: &#8220;F*ck you!&#8221; We laughed.<br />
The evening over, I retreated back to my safe little home to recover from the day. Lest you think I was heavily intoxicated at the time &#8212; I was very sober. In fact, I&#8217;d spent the whole day pretty much peachy. Not driveable-peachy, but not even really buzzed. Hangovers tend to make you not want to drink as much the next day, I find. No, the reason I went home was that I was very, very tired.<br />
And after the last two days, I needed the rest.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Alex and I have been seeing each other for a couple of months now, and we felt it secure enough to try something a little adventurous: a weekend away from the city.<br />
Exactly how we found out about it, I&#8217;m not sure (I think Alex had a pamphlet or flyer), but we decided we would go to Banff (Bamf!), specifically to see a jazz concert at the Banff Centre. As an additional bonus, the Banff Centre offered something called &#8220;Jazz Up Your Weekend&#8221;, which is a package including the tickets to the show and a discounted rate for a room in one of the Banff Centre&#8217;s rooms. (They have a sort-of hotel. Not quite a real hotel, but it&#8217;s close enough.)<br />
We discussed other activities to engage in, but the key reason was the concert. So imagine the disappointment when we found out that tickets were all sold out. But the clerk told me that I could call back later in the week, on the off chance that someone would return the tickets. I &#8220;neglected&#8221; to tell Alex that. (Hey, I gotta put some mystery into this relationship.)<br />
Friday finally rolled around and we were off to Banff (Bamf!). After taking a detour through Market Mall to get a bite to eat, hitting the local 7-11 for a Slurpee, and driving out through Cochrane (only because we could). We finally hit Banff (Bamf!) just after 21:00, and found our way to the Banff Centre. Alex figured it out almost as soon as I turned off Banff Ave., though she didn&#8217;t find out about the concert until later.<br />
After checking in, we stopped briefly at the coffee shop on campus for a chai latte (apparently not too bad) and a hot chocolate (which was little more than steamed chocolate milk). I say &#8220;campus&#8221; because that&#8217;s about the best way to describe the place.<br />
The Banff Centre is a large complex of a couple dozen buildings, ranging in size from small huts to multi-wing dormitory/meeting buildings. The Centre itself is devoted to education and advancement of the arts (including music, fine arts, new media, and dance). Within the Canadian jazz community, it&#8217;s apparently the pinnacle of talent and advancement (as we would find out the next night). Situated on the slopes of Tunnel Mountain, it&#8217;s far enough away from the townsite to be isolated, but close enough that you can walk there in about 10 minutes.<br />
We debated on sleeping in the next morning, but decided to give breakfast a try. Our room came with four coupons, good for a &#8220;complimentary breakfast&#8221;. We had no idea what it was, but figured if the Saturday breakfast was no good, we&#8217;d sleep in on Sunday. Figures that it was a full buffet, including Belgian waffles and fresh omelettes.<br />
Our primary target for the day, concert notwithstanding, was the summit of Sulphur Mountain, tackled by foot. We would walk there, which was a few kilometres from the Centre. We started by heading down Tunnel Mountain Road, following the bend of the Bow River. Or at least that was the plan.<br />
Barely 10 steps onto Tunnel Mountain Road, we spotted a trail leading off into the forest. As we weren&#8217;t in a hurry, we opted for a slight little detour. The detour took us considerably out of our way (we didn&#8217;t realize this until later), but we found the north side of the Bow River to be quite a bit more interesting (and quite a lot less travelled) than the south side (which is where you&#8217;ll find the Banff Springs hotel). The view of the Bow Falls from the north side is also a little harrowing, the slope down into the rapids is high, and quite steep.<br />
We arrived at the base of the trail up Sulphur Mountain about an hour and a half after leaving the Centre. We would take a trip through the Sulphur Mountain Gondola base station to get something to drink (you don&#8217;t climb the mountain without liquids) and something to eat (some delicious fudge). Then it was up the hill.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d tackled Sulphur Mountain was almost three years ago (see [[Visiting Bragg Creek and Elbow Falls, Canada Day in Banff (Bamf!)]]) with Stuart and Therese. It was on a nice, warm, sunny day long after all the snow had melted off the mountain. This time, it was cloudy, a bit cool in the upper climbes, and despite the park rangers having said the path was clear, finding numerous banks of snow (naturally, in all the bends in the switchback path, one of which I got stuck in trying to climb over) and large mud patches.<br />
Along the way, we ran into acquaintances. First was Christian, a fellow Critical Masser, up for the day with his girlfriend for a hike up before the Calgary Flames game that night. Then we ran into an ex-student of Alex&#8217;s (as part of her job, Alex has students work with her to train them to be x-ray technicians) about 3/4 of the way up.<br />
The climb was long (the signs say about two hours) and tiring. I was considerably more tired than I thought I should be, but didn&#8217;t know why until we got to the top. Just over 90 minutes. Alex probably would have killed me for that pace, had she the energy to do so. (The pace, incidentally, was not intentional.) After resting a bit at the top, we headed back to the base station.<br />
By gondola.<br />
We hiked back down to the Banff Springs, taking a &#8220;short cut&#8221; through the forest. We bypassed the hotel, and found ourselves in the middle of a large field, to the south of the golf course. Alex tried to romp through it, but the grass was a little rough. That, and there was plenty of elk dung all over the place. You couldn&#8217;t walk anywhere without running into it (either fresh or long-since dried). We laid down a while, in a relatively dung-free area, before heading along the river and back into town.<br />
We ate a very late lunch (or an early dinner, depending on your point of view) at Bruno&#8217;s. One of the best corned beef sandwiches I&#8217;ve had in a long time, and bar none the best sweet potato fries Alex or I have ever had. We recovered from our massive hike, listening to the Flames fans driving up and down Banff Ave., honking their horns. It seemed that even the little resort town was gearing up for Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.<br />
After a bit of shopping in town, we walked back to the Banff Centre and got ready for the concert. (We both needed showers quite badly.) We then headed over to the Margaret Greenham Theatre, and prepared for a night of jazz.<br />
Yes, we went to a concert instead of watching Game 6. That&#8217;s not to say that we were the only ones missing it. Thankfully, the performers were aware of this and tried their best to provide scores as they became aware of them.<br />
The style of jazz was mostly improvisational. Aside from two pieces (&#8220;Pannonica&#8221; and &#8220;Bye-Ya&#8221;, both by Thelonius Monk), the rest were composed either by the Director of the Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music (Dave Douglas) or by visiting composer and trombonist, George Lewis.<br />
The first set was &#8220;Mountain Passages #1-5&#8221;, written by Douglas, and performed by seven people who came out on stage tied together in mountain climber fashion. This was because the piece (introduced by Douglas) was written to be performed at 10,000 feet elevations. The piece was quite interesting and very intricate. Not at all the kind of jazz I&#8217;d been expecting. It was a prelude of what to expect. Even stranger was the choice of instruments, which included a cello and a banjo.<br />
Upon completion, the group left the stage and a new group came out, approximately 14 people playing two pianos, two cellos (until that point, had never heard of cello in a jazz band), several saxophones, horns, electric guitar, and a double bass. Then Lewis walked out on stage, presumably to take his position as conductor.<br />
I was about to argue against his presence. Why would there need to be a jazz conductor? I&#8217;ve always wondered about the need for a conductor (having never been in a band myself, I should add), since the musicians should know how to play the music. Interestingly, enough, Lewis felt quite the same way, and said as such to the audience, adding: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back when I feel I&#8217;m needed&#8221;. He promptly left the stage, and the band began.<br />
Lewis&#8217;s pieces (&#8220;Smashing Clusters&#8221; and &#8220;Hello/Goodbye&#8221;) are significantly stranger than the jazz music I&#8217;m more familiar with. But from an artistic perspective, it was interesting to watch the performers play such an odd piece of music. I have a great deal of respect for jazz musicians, since they are able to play such eclectic works, and yet still embellish their own style on it (which is more or less expected of them).<br />
A few minutes into the first piece, Lewis came back out on stage, and started directing the band, cutting some people off, encouraging others to play solos, or completely changing the music around. Suddenly, I saw how a conductor (especially the composer) can radically affect the sound. At times, watching Lewis was more entertaining than listening.<br />
The intermission came, and we headed out into the lobby. (The game was tied 2-2, going into overtime.) We shared a ginger ale, to make up for the higher, drier altitude, and for the lack of liquids as a result of all our walking around earlier in the day. About 20 minutes later, the lights blinked, and we headed back in.<br />
As we&#8217;d been informed near the beginning of the show, the performers would be joined by &#8220;Shorty&#8221;, one of George Lewis&#8217;s inventions. Shorty is the combination of a player piano and a software program that runs off a laptop. Three musicians, Dave Douglas (on trumpet), Jason Moran (apparently, a well-known jazz pianist), and Lewis (on trombone) would play with Shorty (for the first time). Shorty is an improvisational piano player, and would adapt to the music played by the other three.<br />
For the record, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of improvisational jazz. I need a melody. Improvisational jazz, to me, is little more than a random series of notes that don&#8217;t really blend together. I don&#8217;t mind improvisation on top of melody, but the melody must exist. Otherwise, it&#8217;s random notes.<br />
That said, watching the three people and one machine play (the piece was titled &#8220;Trip Music for Humans and Non-Humans&#8221;, but I suspect there is no defined score for it) was quite fascinating, especially for someone in the computer field.<br />
Eventually, Shorty was turned off and a dummer and bassist entered the stage, and the five players went into the Monk pieces, and a third by Muhal Richard Abrams, called &#8220;J.G.&#8221;. They blended the pieces so seemlessly that you couldn&#8217;t tell where one piece ended and the next began, if you didn&#8217;t already know the tunes (which I didn&#8217;t). Those last three pieces were the kind of jazz I needed to hear, and it sounded amazing.<br />
Concert over (sadly, with the Flames having lost), Alex and I headed up to the Upper Hot Springs, which are open until 23:00 during the summer season. It was good to climb into the 39-degree water to bake out the stiffness and soreness we could probably expect the following day. We weren&#8217;t the only ones there &#8212; several of the patrons were Japanese tourists, the rest appearing to be locals (including several teenagers).<br />
We stopped at the Mac&#8217;s on the way back, picking up some snack food, so we&#8217;d have something to eat while we shared a bottle of wine back at the hotel.<br />
Breakfast got us out of bed early again, though we had French toast instead of waffles this time. Having no particular plans for the rest of the morning, we took things slowly, eventually heading downtown to do some shopping. I didn&#8217;t end up buying anything (though I was looking around).<br />
Around 14:00, we headed up to the Banff Springs to partake of Afternoon Tea. I&#8217;d always heard it was a great place to go, and really wanted to see what it would be like. Unfortunately, it would be something we&#8217;d have to experience another day. The activity of the day before had caused Alex to experience a bit of a headache, which since waking that morning blew up into a full-blown migraine. The only thing we could do at that point was go home.<br />
Summer has arrived in southern Alberta (finally), which means that this won&#8217;t be the only time Alex and I go to Banff (Bamf!). Hopefully, you&#8217;ll see more entries from that area, replete with additional tales of &#8230; well, stuff.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s just something inherently wrong with watching Stanley Cup hockey while sweating because it&#8217;s so warm. The season needs to be shorter.<br />
Or there need to be fewer teams, especially in places where you can&#8217;t naturally have ice outside. (But that&#8217;s just a personal gripe.)<br />
Last night was Game 5 in the Tampa Bay-Calgary Stanley Cup Final series. As is becoming a habit, Craig organized a gathering at the Rose and Crown, one of Calgary&#8217;s more popular watering holes. A former employee of the Rose, Craig was able to secure spaces on the third floor for us, so we&#8217;d have a place to sit and watch. Assuming we got there early enough to actually get a seat and not end up having to stand.<br />
Which of course meant that not only would the office be let out at 16:30 (it was for the last game), but I&#8217;d get stuck in an interview for a new Web Developer position until 16:50. I ended up jogging from the office (corner of 11th Ave. and 3rd St. SE) to the Rose (corner of 15th Ave. and 4th ST. SW) &#8212; a distance of about 11 blocks. All my gym excursions and healthy habits apparently have paid off &#8212; even with poor running shoes, I got there without feeling like I was going to have a heart attack.<br />
Many people sang along with Hockey Night in Canada&#8217;s opening theme, and with &#8220;O Canada&#8221;. But the cheering really didn&#8217;t kick in until the game got going. The series was tied at two games apiece, and both teams needed the advantage. Walking into Game 6 will either be staying alive or trying for the win, and it would better to be the latter.<br />
The volume in the bar was quite high &#8230; and we could barely hear the TVs. Everyone was yelling, shouting, cavorting, and several of us (Paul, Scott, Thelton, Keith, among others) were taking pictures of all the mayhem. Thelton was having particular fun emailing all the photos he&#8217;d taken with his cellphone immediately to the Calgary office email alias, to ensure that everyone arriving in the morning would see all the &#8220;glory&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;m sure the patrons downstairs from us really came to despise the noisy folks on the top floor. We would stomp the floor rhythmically, chanting &#8220;Go Flames Go&#8221; as loud as we could. We would scream and yell whenever Calgary got close to Tampa Bay&#8217;s goal. The table of Cory, Chrissie, Michelle, Colin, Neil, Jason, Carl, and Julianne would chant about others in the room, for example: &#8220;Let&#8217;s go , let&#8217;s go!&#8221; until they either acknowledged the chant, or the chanters got bored and picked on someone else.<br />
The game itself was nerve-wracking. It was close. Calgary would score, then Tampa would score. It was tied when the clock ran out, and overtime began. I hate overtime. It&#8217;s such a toss-up. First goal wins, and you really get nervous when pucks get to close to your own goal. Luckily, Kiprusoff is a strong goalie, and Calgary&#8217;s defense was all over Tampa. And so it came down to the last five minutes of the first overtime period when Calgary finally popped the puck in.<br />
Total pandemonium.<br />
Within mere seconds, 17th Ave. was full of people, and traffic evacuated to the side streets. We weren&#8217;t far behind, though we had to do a couple of shots at the bar before we could get out the door. Then it was out to the Red Mile, and wandering in the direction of Melrose. The Red Sea had poured into the Red Mile.<br />
Unlike our previous ventures out onto 17th Ave. (see [[Calgary Flames win Western Conference]] and [[Calgary Flames and the 2004 Stanley Cup]]), this was a warm, dry evening, and was perfect fuel for the flashing fire. As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard (as most of North America has), Calgary&#8217;s Red Mile has turned into a &#8220;Girls Gone Wild&#8221; breast-fest of flashing. There&#8217;s websites devoted to this stuff. I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ll even be able to find videos in adult stores before too long (assuming, of course, that they&#8217;re not already there). It&#8217;s pretty weird, considering how this city is most of the year (save for Stampede, of course). You&#8217;d almost think we were in New Orleans or Mexico&#8230; Am I going to argue about it? No point, and no, it&#8217;s not because I want to encourage it. If people feel that liberated, all the power to them. I just hope that they consider some of the consequences.<br />
Angie got hoisted into the air on Thelton&#8217;s shoulders. Almost immediately, she was surrounded by a multitude of hormone- (and alcohol-) fuelled idiots, calling for Angie to remove her shirt. Angie, who has been known to do daring things in the past (and probably wouldn&#8217;t be objected from doing them under other circumstances) basically told them to grow up and take a hike, and returned to ground level.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay on 17th Ave. for too long, and started off in search of something else. For some reason, that was Cowboys, a bar just north of the railway tracks. After finding Angie&#8217;s car (she couldn&#8217;t quite remember where she&#8217;d parked), we wandered up 5th St., listening to the incoherent shouts above the cacaphony of car horns.<br />
When we arrived at Cowboys, I bade the others a good evening, as I headed home. Why? Simple reason: I have a moral objection to Cowboys. I do not wish to EVER enter an establishment whose waitstaff are known to have breast implants (rumoured to be paid by the bar&#8217;s owner), and over whose door there is a sign that reads: &#8220;Through these doors walk the most beautiful women in Alberta&#8221;. Thanks, but no thanks.<br />
I was quite tired when I finally got home. It was late, I was still a little inebriated, and I had to go to work the next day. One major advantage of having gone drinking with the group, though:<br />
You fall asleep fast.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last night, Alex and I headed down to the Glenmore Reservoir. Reasons were two-fold: One was to have a picnic, a little meal on the edge of the largest body of water in the immediate area. The other was for Alex&#8217;s dragon boat practice. (You might remember that from [[Victoria Day Long Weekend Aftermath]].)<br />
The weather wasn&#8217;t particularly good (nor was the fact that the entire city was going gonzo for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals, tying up traffic something awful), but we still managed to make the most of the ham and cheese sandwiches, potato salad, and fruit that we&#8217;d brought with us. The breeze was cool, tempered with a few spots of precipitation. But we still managed to eat most of our food without extreme difficulty. (On a sunnier day, I can see this area being significantly more attractive.)<br />
Leaving some of the fruit behind for post-practice, we ducked over to the McDonald&#8217;s at Glenmore Landing (a small strip mall on the eastern shore of the reservoir) for apple pies. It was my first McDonald&#8217;s apple pie. They&#8217;re not bad. I don&#8217;t want to know what&#8217;s in them, though, since I&#8217;d probably feel the urge to go into a full cleanse to get that gunk back out of me.<br />
Soon, we were at the boat dock, waiting for the rest of Alex&#8217;s team to show up. The game would keep many of them away, leaving only about eight people out of the usual 20-person team. Which is how I got sucked into all of this.<br />
I was a decided spectator. I had thought about doing dragon boat racing when I lived in Vancouver, but the team never really took off in the last year I was able to apply. Until I&#8217;d met Alex, I didn&#8217;t even know there was racing in Calgary! But sure enough, every August, there&#8217;s a festival on the reservoir. Apparently, it&#8217;s quite large. And unless things change between Alex and I (highly unlikely), I&#8217;ll get to find out what it&#8217;s like.<br />
The current question, though, is whether I&#8217;ll get to see it as a spectator or as a participant.<br />
With so few people out, I was asked to join them on the water. (I had planned to listen to the game in the car.) I was in the process of politely refusing when I saw the expectant smile on Alex&#8217;s face.<br />
Hook, line, and sinker.<br />
Bundled up, lifejacket on, and paddle in hand, I followed the others down to the long, white canoe at the dock. Dragon boats are long &#8212; 20 people rowing, one helmsman, and one &#8220;drummer&#8221;. This means the boats are also fairly tall on the water (until you get people into them, anyway). I was positioned slightly ahead of middle, seated next to Moustafa, a veteran from last year. Once we were all in, we headed off onto the lake. And a lot of back pain.<br />
Don&#8217;t worry, I didn&#8217;t injure myself. It&#8217;s from the rowing. Dragon boats aren&#8217;t paddled like a canoe. When you paddle a canoe, you look forward, and paddle with your arms and upper body. The motion is simple, and unless you&#8217;re paddling hard, there&#8217;s not too much to it. Dragon boats, on the other hand, are quite something else. To maximize power, you need to hold the paddle with straight arms (ideally, when you&#8217;re holding the paddle correctly, your body and paddle form an &#8216;A&#8217;, with torso and arm creating one side, lower arm creating the cross, and paddle forming the other side). You stroke by rotating your arms opposite to rotating your torso. It&#8217;s a bit weird to explain, but once you see it, it makes sense.<br />
And it hurts. Especially when you&#8217;re under power. Which were were. Several times.<br />
But the technique isn&#8217;t too hard to pick up. The trick then is timing. You need everyone in the boat to have the same timing for strokes. When people are out of stroke, you lose power. The most power is gained when everyone strokes at the same time. It wasn&#8217;t hard to tell just in our practices. Our coach, Albert, had the most power, and was something to behold. He&#8217;s been doing it a few years, though, so his strength is not to be unexpected.<br />
I was tired by the time we got into shore. Like with many things, I pushed myself quite hard. I hope my back doesn&#8217;t avenge itself on me tomorrow, though. (Yoga might help, though, if it does.) But I think I&#8217;m getting addicted. I can see myself doing this. I don&#8217;t really know why, other than it&#8217;s fun.<br />
Certainly beats just watching.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When spring is in full-swing in Calgary, there are always fun things to do. The only problem, though, is having to choose which ones &#8212; once the warm weather hits, there can sometimes be a few too many things to do all at the same time.<br />
The last Sunday in May is the Calgary Lilac Festival. This is essentially a long market-cum-showcase that runs along 4th St. SW, from 13th Ave. all the way down to the Elbow River (about 25th Ave., I think). The only road that cuts across is 17th Ave. &#8212; you can&#8217;t really stop that traffic during the day. This is a chance for a lot of vendors to showcase wares that might not normally get the exposure, for the Kettle Korn vendors to come out of the woodwork (as they so rarely do outside of the Calgary Stampede), and for a tens of thousands of people to cram into small spaces to do strange things.<br />
But first, we went to a triathlon.<br />
The Try This Try-athlon is not a full triathlon. It follows the same basic pattern (swim, bike, run), but with considerably shorter distances. The swimming leg is 500 metres (full triathlon swimming courses are over three and a half kilometres), the biking leg is 15 km or three laps of the university (full courses are just over 180 km), and the running is a mere three kilometres (the full courses are full marathon length &#8212; 42.4 kilometres).<br />
Unlike other larger-scale triathlons (such as the world-famous Ironman races), the Try This is run in waves. This is mostly because Calgary has no sufficiently large &#8220;natural&#8221; body of water to accomodate so many racers and provide a sufficient distance. (The Glenmore Reservoir could, but you&#8217;re not allowed to swim in it.) So the Foothills Pool had to provide swimming space. Hence, the waves. There were about 230 racers in total, and waves that ran until about 10:30 or so.<br />
We arrived just after 9:45, hoping to find Alex&#8217;s two friends, Randy and Yolanda. We found out almost right away that the times had been bumped up to try and get people through even quicker than scheduled. Randy was literally getting out of the pool as we entered the viewing area, so we missed him until he was well into his biking run. Yolanda was still there, but we would catch her on the way out to her bike, and out onto the bike course.<br />
The day was starting off to be absolutely gorgeous, with bright, warm sun and only a few clouds in the sky. The temperature was a little coolish, but not so much that we were shivering without jackets. (Well, when we were in the sun, anyway.) As the race came towards a close, with Randy&#8217;s crossing of the finish line in just over an hour, to Yolanda&#8217;s finish minutes later, we were also met with a sad fact of living in Calgary&#8230;<br />
The weather here is most unpredictable.<br />
Clouds started rolling in, and our glorious sunshine became dreary gray. Alex and I headed down to a side street just west of 4th St. (I can&#8217;t remember the name for the life of me, or exactly how we got there), and walked over to 4th St. and 25th Ave. So began our three-odd-hour tour of the Lilac Festival.<br />
The street, as in years past, was lined with all sorts of foods, curios, clothes, and performers of all kinds. If you wanted it, chances are that it was there, somewhere, on 4th St. A new addition this year, with the on-coming Federal election, were representatives of the Liberal, Conservative, and Green parties. There were also a couple of other political groups, advocating full democracy (majority wins) vs. the &#8220;first in the door&#8221; system we currently have. Not sure if there&#8217;s any particular advantage to one over the other, except that &#8220;first in the door&#8221; usually allows the elections to end sooner. The NDP were also out, though more as activists who roamed the street.<br />
We were starving, barely four blocks into the tour. A large slice of pizza and a Coke kept us going for a while. We looped at the top and worked our way down, periodically getting sprayed by the occasional burst of rain. When we reached 17th Ave. on the way back down, I suggested we duck down 17th. to check out a couple of stores. Most notably, Gravity Pope. I need new sandals. My current ones are shot. They&#8217;re seven years old and barely holding together. But I was denied of the ones I wanted.<br />
Alex suggested we also check out Reid&#8217;s while we were there, so continued west. At the Ship and Anchor, we ran into Jensenne, Doug, and Jordon. They hadn&#8217;t been particularly thrilled with the festival thus far, and were taking a break. After a quick chat, we headed to Reid&#8217;s, only to find it closed on the Sunday. So back to 4th St.<br />
We stopped a few times at stores and kiosks &#8212; Alex found the coolest pair of &#8230; well, not capri pants, but let&#8217;s call them long beach shorts. Or something like that. Either way, they looked good, even if they did bulge a bit at the front. But we could barely get back to our starting point. The throngs of people (including one guy who decided to take his 10-foot python for a walk) were a bit much, and it was time to head out. We were a little tired, and a bit of a break sounded like a good idea.<br />
We passed out for an hour and a half. But it was much deserved. We&#8217;d done a lot of walking. And despite the turn in the weather, it had still been a good day.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Now this is the way to have a weekend go for you. I was with Alex much of this weekend &#8212; a very good thing, if you ask me &#8212; and we got to chatting, as we often do. I&#8217;ve been trying to hold back on some of my feelings for Alex, mostly because they can be like a tsunami at times, and I don&#8217;t want to drown her in them.<br />
Yes, I like Alex. I like her a lot. I like her so much that at times I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m coming or going. Even just holding her brings me a peace that I haven&#8217;t felt &#8230; in so long, I honestly can&#8217;t remember when I last felt it. I consider this to be extremely good for me. But at the same time, I don&#8217;t want to really express how strongly I feel. Why? As Kristen has pointed out to me, I can be very overwhelming, and say things that can put people off. I don&#8217;t want to ruin anything with Alex, and I sure as hell don&#8217;t want to scare her off.<br />
I ended up saying something like: &#8220;You&#8217;re very special to me, and I hate not being with you&#8221;, or something like that. I was trying to phrase something carefully, so that it would sound genuine, without being too stalker-ish. What I got in return just about threw me for a loop.<br />
&#8220;I think I&#8217;m falling in love with you.&#8221;<br />
For months, the world has been spinning too quickly, and I&#8217;ve really wanted nothing more than to get off this crazy merry-go-round for a while. With that simple phrase, the world came to a grinding halt. This was not at all what I&#8217;d expected to hear. My heart skipped a beat, and I nearly cried. It meant more to me than anything else that has happened to me in a very long time.<br />
Okay, reality check: *I think* and *falling in love* do not equate to &#8220;I love you&#8221;, so don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m getting any allusions to what Alex has said. But even the consideration means more than anything else I could have imagined.<br />
It&#8217;s been well over five years since the last time I heard anyone (other than friends or family) tell me that they loved me (or were thinking of falling in love with me). It&#8217;s been longer than that where I actually believed what was being said. It&#8217;s something amazing to hear, and it really leaves you with the most amazing feeling afterwards.<br />
I feel alive. For the first time in a long time, I honestly feel alive. Long nearly-dead emotions are coming to life again. I look forward to the future, and don&#8217;t worry about being at home all the time. It&#8217;s great. (The lawn&#8217;s getting a little too long, but it&#8217;ll survive without me a while.) Relax, I&#8217;m not rushing out to buy a ring or something. After Allison, things are going to go decidedly more careful this time around. I think I&#8217;m going to be a little more prepared this time, though.<br />
So yes, I guess this is a LavaLife success story. To say that almost cheapens things in a way, like we had to rely on a dating service to bring us together. But that&#8217;s the thing about something like this &#8212; Alex and I would never have met otherwise, our circles in life are too far apart. The bridging will still take a while, but in the end, it&#8217;s all good.<br />
Next weekend, we&#8217;re going to do our first major outing as a couple. We&#8217;re going to Banff. I can&#8217;t wait, and it&#8217;s almost a week away.<br />
I think I&#8217;m falling in love, too.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>15 years ago tonight, the Calgary Flames won the Stanley Cup. Tonight, they have only three games until they win it again.<br />
It is, admittedly, a nice way to start the week off after a long weekend. The first long weekend of the summer season, it is Victoria Day when Calgary&#8217;s resident population dips precariously low as most take off for the mountains. In many cases, this wasn&#8217;t a particularly bright move, since the weather wasn&#8217;t exactly ideal. Namely, it snowed. Again. As usual.<br />
Well, that was in the mountains. It wasn&#8217;t too bad here, actually. Saturday and Sunday were cool, Saturday being the more miserable of the two (light &#8220;snow&#8221; that melted on contact with the ground). Monday was a welcome break, and was much more bearable, the comfortable conditions lasting well into the evening. Definitely a sure sign of improving weather.<br />
Friday ended early for Critical Mass, and many people took advantage by disappearing at 16:00. (Not that a single hour would have made that much difference &#8212; almost half the office had already taken the day off.) I stuck around a bit longer, mostly because I had to finish up some loose ends. But also because I was going to get a lift from the office that afternoon, so didn&#8217;t feel like going home first. (Hey, it seemed logical to me.)<br />
Shortly before 17:00, my phone rang. It was Alex, my ride. She was on her way, and would rendez-vous with me shortly. (She arrived about 20 minutes later.) We didn&#8217;t leave immediately, as I wanted to give her a quick tour of Critical Mass&#8217;s rather swanky office space. (Okay, so it&#8217;s not really *swanky*, but it is pretty cool. We just have to be reminded of that from time to time.) Then it was off to Chinook.<br />
We were meeting up with several of Alex&#8217;s co-workers and my friend Adrian (one of my co-workers, too) to catch a viewing of &#8220;Shrek 2&#8221;. Alex and I would make a pit stop at the food court to grab a tuna fish sub from Quizno&#8217;s first. (We hadn&#8217;t eaten yet, and the prospect of going without food was a little on the unbearable side.) Finishing, we hiked down to the other end of the mall to the theatres, where we found Alex&#8217;s co-workers. (Adrian would join us, sans cast, a few moments later.)<br />
For the record, I laughed myself silly in &#8220;Shrek 2&#8221;. It&#8217;s hard not to. Okay, yes, Shrek is a kindler, gentler ogre than the first movie. Despite his lack of cantankerousness, he still has his moments &#8230; the rest are stolen by Donkey (of course), Puss in Boots (awesomely voiced by Antonio Banderas), or the group of three blind mice, Pinocchio, the Gingerbread Man, and the three little pigs reenacting scenes from a number of movies. Some say it&#8217;s not nearly as good as the first movie, but I think it&#8217;s got a lot going for it. (I&#8217;ve already seen it twice, so I have a fairly good opinion of it.)<br />
The next evening, Alex returned the favour for office tours. Alex &#8230; hmm, it just dawned on me that you have no idea who I&#8217;m talking about. Alex (short for Alexandra, though she prefers the abbreviated version of her name) is my new girlfriend. We&#8217;ve been seeing each other for a little over a month, and things seem to get better every day. Actually, that&#8217;s not true or fair. We&#8217;d actually started seeing each other back in early January, but I really screwed up and we stopped seeing each other for a while. Thankfully, Alex has more sense in these things than I do, and called me just before I went to Japan.<br />
She&#8217;s a lot of fun, a little quirky (which, considering me, is a very good quality), really cute, and has the brains to back it all up. She&#8217;s an X-ray technician at one of the local hospitals (sorry, but I&#8217;m not going to say which one just yet), so that leads to a lot of very interesting conversations. And she&#8217;s a huge fan of Jann Arden (given, not that I know a lot of Jann&#8217;s stuff, but that ought to please Cathy).<br />
Back to the tour. As you&#8217;ve guessed, Alex took me to her place of employment &#8212; the hospital. It was a bit of a peculiar thing, going to a hospital for no reason other than to go to the hospital. I&#8217;ve never sight-seen a hospital before. It&#8217;s a bit of an unusual experience. Especially when the tour is guided and you get to see a few things that most non-medical people don&#8217;t get to see. Like the x-ray machines up close, and from a point of view where you can actually see the thing. I learned more about radiography in a couple of short hours than I thought was possible. I now know how modern x-rays are taken (all digital), the kinds of equipment that are used to produce quality images, and why the Philips equipment isn&#8217;t particularly desired.<br />
Sunday and Monday were rest days for me. Lots of &#8230; well, not much of anything, really. A trip out to Costco amounted to my major activity for Sunday. Monday was a trip to the gym and a repeat viewing of &#8220;Shrek 2&#8221;. Monday evening, I accompanied Alex to her dragon boat practice down on the Glenmore Reservoir. I was a mere spectator, but it was an interesting time.<br />
Summer hasn&#8217;t yet officially arrived here in Calgary (and probably won&#8217;t until after the Cup has come home &#8212; yes, we&#8217;re very optimistic around here), but already it&#8217;s looking to be a very good one.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Flames Fever is running at a pitch I could have never have imagined before. Tonight, it broke a new high.<br />
Tonight was game six in the NHL Western Conference final, pitting the Calgary Flames against the San Jose Sharks. So far, this has produced some extremely frustrating games, most notably when I sit and yell at the Flames&#8217; tendency to monkey around with the puck on powerplays, rather than do what they need to do, which is get in the other team&#8217;s face and snap the puck in when the goalie isn&#8217;t watching. They&#8217;ve done it before many times, and Iginla (in particular) is pretty good with stabbing in pucks on breakaways, so it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re not aware that it works. They just need to put it into a little more practice.<br />
We decided to avoid doing the bar thing, unlike our previous times (see [[Calgary Flames and the 2004 Stanley Cup]]). Why? Well, you can only see so many games in bars before you start feeling the urge to take up smoking and your bank account runs exceedingly low. Such as it was, we ended up at Jensenne and Jon&#8217;s place. &#8220;We&#8221; was Jordon, Mike, Mark, Adrian, Doug, Jensenne, Jon, and myself. (Tamara had to go to some Macromedia conference, and I have no idea where Dan was.)<br />
The game was an intense rush of power. The Flames were playing at home, and the whole city was excited. The noise in the dome could only be counted as excrutiatingly loud (confirmed later on in the evening). The noise in and around the apartment was just as excited, even if in smaller numbers. Each Flames goal came with a boisterous yell (and numerous horn honks from outside), but none so much as when the third and final puck crossed the Sharks&#8217; goal line with tenths of a second remaining. I was leaving a message for Tamara at the time (to inform her of the victory), which went something like this:<br />
&#8220;Hey Tamara, it&#8217;s Geoff. Just to let you know that it&#8217;s 10 seconds left in the game, and Flames are up 2-1. It&#8217;s five seconds and OH MY GOD YES YEEESSSSS!! WOO HOOO!!!&#8221;<br />
I don&#8217;t know if she actually understood what I&#8217;d said.<br />
Victory in hand, we followed the rest of Calgary out onto the streets, heading towards Melrose on 17th Ave. It was sheer insanity. I thought the first two times that I&#8217;d been down there were crazy. 17th Ave was already a pedestrian walkway by the time we got there &#8212; mere minutes after the game had actually finished. The slight spattering of rain did nothing to deter the emotions. The Mardi Gras spirit (most notably the bared breasts that have made national news) was even more amplified. Homemade Stanley Cups were paraded around for all to see, and nearly everyone was Flames attire.<br />
There&#8217;s a reason this area is called the &#8220;Red Mile&#8221;.<br />
We proceeded past Melrose, continuing to Ming. I don&#8217;t know why we went down there. It&#8217;s not a great bar, really, and while we could get drinks, it didn&#8217;t really strike me as a great place to be. The one thing that was interesting was watching the near-constant tide of people continually walking west along 17th towards Melrose. We were at Ming over an hour, and the flow rarely curbed. I could not figure out where all these people were coming from!<br />
As chance would have it, I even managed to spot a friend of mine in the crowd. Kristen has had what I would refer to as insane luck in trying to get tickets to the games. (To say I&#8217;m jealous is to put it mildly.) I managed to spot her as she wandered down 17th Ave. with everyone else. She was a bit surprised to see me, but couldn&#8217;t hear much of what I said. (Remember how I said it was loud? I wasn&#8217;t kidding.)<br />
Tamara eventually joined up with us, and Dan soon appeared with his friends. The party would continue well into the wee hours of the morning. But without me. I needed to go home &#8212; some of us have to work tomorrow.<br />
For the first time in 15 years, the Flames have made it to the Stanley Cup. We play either the Tampa Bay Lightning or the Philadelphia Flyers. No matter who it is, we can only expect the Red Sea (the crowd at the dome who wear nothing but red) to get more intense, the the Red Mile to get even longer.</p>
