	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We&#8217;ve been blessed with a good winter this year &#8212; it hasn&#8217;t rained much. (Of course, I would be writing this on a rainy day.) In fact, we&#8217;ve had a lot of sun, though it has been fairly chilly. Yes, I realize that chilly here is warm compared to the rest of Canada right now. What can I say &#8212; I&#8217;m a wimp.<br />
But even with all that good weather, Vancouver can get a little boring, especially if you don&#8217;t get out a lot. This was our problem &#8212; we hadn&#8217;t really gone anywhere except for the island in the past three months. So Allison and I decided it was time to visit Seattle again. A good road trip was just what we needed.<br />
We got up relatively early on Saturday (which for me, is before 9:00am) and got ready to leave. By 9:09, we were fuelled up and heading south on Burrard for our adventure of the day. We arrived at the border in short time, and breezed through, as usual. It was a good thing we weren&#8217;t coming from Seattle to Vancouver, though &#8212; the lineup looked about an hour in length.<br />
It was a good day for the drive &#8212; the sun was bright and the sky was (mostly) clear. We could see Mt. Baker quite easily. It&#8217;s a very imposing mountain, especially when you know that it&#8217;s two hours away, and the ones just across the Burrard Inlet look the same height. It&#8217;s huge &#8230; just like its sister mountain, Mt. Rainier. Both are dormant volcanos &#8230; just like Mount St. Helen&#8217;s was dormant.<br />
We found ourselves in downtown Seattle just after 12:00, just in time for lunch. We drove around attempting to find inexpensive parking (by inexpensive, we were looking for anything that charged less than US$7 an hour. Seattle is expensive.<br />
We eventually ended up at the lot Allison and her friend had once used when visiting Seattle. It has a US$5 special that lets you park for up to 10 hours. It&#8217;s not the most convenient location, but considering that there&#8217;s no lot attendant, no pavement, and nothing really nearby, it&#8217;s fairly reasonable.<br />
Actually, there is one thing nearby &#8212; an elevator. It takes you up to what used to be a causeway from &#8220;upper&#8221; Seattle to the piers on the waterfront. When the piers closed down, the causeway was mostly destroyed. Part of it remained, and the city (assumedly it was them) put in an elevator to let you down to the harbourfront. At the top, it let you out two blocks from Pike Place Market. Convenient, non?<br />
The first order of business was lunch. We had seen a mexican restaurant while searching for parking, but we were interested in a chili place at the south end of the market. It took a while to get there (about half the population of Washington State was crammed into the three blocks that make up the market area), and we were disappointed when we arrived. It seems that the owner/operator had been made an Honorary Member of the Coronary Bypass Association, and was enjoying an extended stay in the Swedish Hospital.<br />
Yeah, you&#8217;re probably thinking what we thought &#8212; he was in Sweden, the reason he wasn&#8217;t here to run the store, right? Well, it wasn&#8217;t until our little attempt to get lost in Seattle that we found the Swedish Hospital. It&#8217;s one of the hospitals in Seattle. Why &#8220;Swedish&#8221;? It was started in Seattle by a pair of Swedes back at the turn of the century. It&#8217;s now one of the largest hospitals in the state.<br />
Anyway, back to the story&#8230;<br />
Finding there would be no chili that day, we went out in search of our mysterious Mexican restaurant. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t hard &#8212; Taco Del Mar. It was a kind of fancy Taco Bell, without all the choices. But I was in the mood for a burrito, and that seemed to be their speciality. I got the jumbo spicy beef (which was their smallest burrito &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why they called it &#8220;jumbo&#8221;). Allison got the super burrito (the same as the jumbo, except it had guacamole).<br />
Kinda bland, not nearly as tasty as the burritos we had at some rinky-dinky little taco stand in Anaheim, but filling. At least we wouldn&#8217;t starve for the rest of the day. And the service was outstandingly pleasant for a fast-food joint. A definite thumbs up, if just for the service alone.<br />
Afterwards, we opted to try something we hadn&#8217;t done before &#8212; go to the Seattle Art Museum. Allison had been craving some intellectual input lately, and I thought a visit to the museum would be a good idea. The last time we were in Seattle, they were exhibiting Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s designs. This time, it was the History of Porcelain. Okay, maybe not the most riveting of subjects, but interesting nonetheless.<br />
The Chinese first started producing the fine porcelain we all know in the 10th Century CE (AD, for those of you not familiar with the Common Era system). However, they had developed the materials and techniques around 3200 BCE &#8230; a lot earlier than most people would have thought. In fact, the only thing that kept them from making good porcelain back then was a lack of heat. Porcelain needs temperatures of about 1,300 C to become porcelain &#8230; otherwise, you just get earthenware. Not as strong, and not as nice.<br />
There were some amazing specimens. Utterly beautiful in design, completely perfect in shape and colour. The designs on them intricate and delicate. Then you read the tag, and find that the bowl, or plate, or water jug you are looking at predates Chris Columbus&#8217; little sojourn to North America by a hundred years.<br />
The exhibit was arranged so that you walked in a loop, starting with the &#8220;birth&#8221; of porcelain, and ending with its &#8220;end&#8221;. (No, we haven&#8217;t disposed of porcelain, just that porcelain is now a pottery technique, not a commodity considered more valuable than precious metals.) The exhibit tells how until the 17th and 18th centuries, most of the porcelain came from China. But after a couple of wars, the technique finally leaked to Japan and Korea, and the supply increased. It wasn&#8217;t until the 17th century that Europe began to tinker with the techniques and come up with its own porcelain.<br />
After our tour of expensive pottery, we ventured to an exhibit of native art. A lot of it was Australian, and actually fairly difficult to look at (the pictures were a bit on the psychedelic side). We didn&#8217;t stay long, and opted for the more typical parts of an art museum: Ancient Mediterranean (e.g. Roman, Greek, Egyptian), the 17th century masters, 18th century art, 19th century Americana, and 20th century moderne, including photographs and a set of prints by Liechtenstein.<br />
We returned to the market, and walked through it again in the opposite direction. (This was when we learned the fate of the chili shop&#8217;s owner.) Like Vancouver&#8217;s Granville Island, the contents of Pike Place Market change fairly regularly, which makes finding some things fairly difficult. All depends on your needs, I guess. Anyway, we wandered around a bit before ending up at a small park overlooking the harbour. There, we sat on the grass, warmed ourselves in the sun, and watched the world walk by.<br />
After a while, we hit upon the idea of touring around Seattle. While Allison had been through other portions of the city before, I had only been in the downtown core. I wanted to see the rest of it. We returned to the car, and drove our way into the heart of the city &#8230; after I missed a turn and ended up in a different area. We were attempting to find Capitol Hill on our own. There were no signs, no hints, and we had no map. It makes for an interesting adventure.<br />
We drove around in seemingly endless loops (you have to understand that we weren&#8217;t really heading in any particular direction), eventually finding ourselves next to the convention centre. We headed east from there, soon finding ourselves at the Edward Nordstrom Medical Tower. This was when we found Seattle University and the Swedish Hospital. We headed south for a little ways until we opted to turn into one of the neighbourhoods &#8212; First Hill.<br />
First Hill is so named because it was one of Seattle&#8217;s first neighbourhoods. Thus, it is also one of the oldest &#8230; and it certainly looks that way. Most of the homes are run-down and/or boarded up. The neighbourhood is mostly poor. It&#8217;s sad, really, because with a little money, most of the homes would look much better.<br />
We soon found ourselves on 23rd Ave., turning north. We still didn&#8217;t know where Capitol Hill was, and it was time for us to find out. We popped into an AM/PM and picked up two Cokes and a map of Seattle. The map had all the information we wanted. Much to our surprise, we were not only in the right area, we weren&#8217;t far away from Capitol Hill. Another kilometre or so north on 23rd, and we were there.<br />
Capitol Hill looks like the kind of neighbourhood you see in Hollywood movies &#8212; nice, large homes on moderately-sized lots in a very nice area. Basically, a rich area. We drove up and down Capitol Hill&#8217;s streets, gaping at the homes, very much wishing that we could afford one.<br />
We soon left, on our second search of the day. Now, this quest definitely shows off our geekhood &#8212; we wanted to find Microsoft. I had a minor fascination with seeing what this company was actually like. One of the world&#8217;s most powerful companies, and all I&#8217;d ever actually seen was a small picture of one of its buildings (which, it turns out, is the recruiting building).<br />
We headed north on 23rd Ave. (which turns into 24th), and looked for off-ramp for Highway 520 East. We missed it, and ended up heading directly into the University of Washington. I was reminded very soon after of the long debates on USENET about who should own the uw.* hierarchy &#8212; the University of Washington, or the University of Waterloo. Several other UW schools tried to get into the debate, but we shut them out pretty quickly.<br />
The university is quite large, and has a nice campus. The buildings are old (or at least look old), much like the Ivy League schools back east. One of them is the Mary Gates building, named after Bill Gates&#8217; late mother, who was also a schoolteacher, UW regent, and a chair of United Way International. I guess Billy gets his goodwill from his mom.<br />
Finding our way to Highway 520, we headed for Redmond. We really had no exact idea where we were going, other than Redmond. We didn&#8217;t have directions, we didn&#8217;t know where in Redmond Microsoft lay, and our map didn&#8217;t show roads any smaller than the major highways.<br />
Arriving in Redmond about 30 minutes later, we proceeded to search. Redmond has two things: Industrial parks populated almost entirely by high-tech companies, and townhouses. There are a few actual houses, but the domicile of preference seems to be the higher-density models. It fits with the youngish population, I suppose.<br />
We drove around the city, covering the north, east, and west sides before finally stopping at a gas station for assistance. The clerk gave me a strange look, and with a straight face provided me directions. She probably added &#8220;geek&#8221; or &#8220;weirdo&#8221; as I left.<br />
Microsoft probably moved to Redmond because it needed space. A lot of space. A huge amount of space. The campus (and it really is a campus) is larger than most (if not all) Canadian universities. It&#8217;s not just huge, it&#8217;s freakin&#8217; huge. There are at least 50 buildings scattered about the area, covering every portion of the company. It&#8217;s impressive.<br />
The scary part is that there is no construction going on at Microsoft. All the buildings are complete. And full. This includes a conference centre, dormitories (large ones, about 20 storeys each), research labs, and separate offices for the Internet portions of the company. It&#8217;s frightening, just plain frightening. You actually have to wonder why the FTC hasn&#8217;t broken the company up yet.<br />
After our little tour, we returned to the highway, and headed our way home. The trip back was as uneventful as the trip down, and without the sun blinding our every movement. A couple of hours later, we arrived at the Cloverdale Truck crossing, and made our way back into Canada. Then we were off to find dinner.<br />
Originally, we were heading for the Langley crossing, which would have put us near the Sammy J. Peppers in Langley (or Surrey &#8230; one of the two). But we were a fair distance from it. So instead, we went to find the Sammy J. Peppers in Coquitlam. Along with the rest of the Lower Mainland.<br />
Luckily, we got there as the crowd was beginning to die down. We indulged ourselves in a nice meal, and prepared to retire to home with a good movie &#8212; Steve Martin&#8217;s &#8220;Bowfinger&#8221;.<br />
Sunday was our lazy day. We got up late, we didn&#8217;t move fast or far. Although we did for a long walk, eventually ending up at Urban Fare to get fixin&#8217;s for dinner. A fairly relaxing day.<br />
I&#8217;m glad we took the time to do all this &#8212; this week is going to be rough. I&#8217;ve got a small mountain of work that should probably kick into full gear by mid-afternoon today. Then I get to lock myself away until Friday, when the drafts are due. All supposed to be done by Tuesday. That&#8217;s my drop-dead date.<br />
I hate deadlines.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>[Ed. Note: This entry actually spans two weeks and is a composite of several private entries that were never mailed out. They first appeared on the web six months after they were written.]<br />
I feel like I&#8217;m in a nightmare, or at least a bad dream. The kind of dream where no matter how fast you can run, you can&#8217;t run fast enough. The kind where you&#8217;re not sure if you&#8217;re certain you&#8217;re not awake, but you can&#8217;t tell if you&#8217;re dreaming. It&#8217;s where the world is hazy and you&#8217;re a minute or two behind the world.<br />
I hate myself for what I&#8217;m going to do, and I haven&#8217;t even done it yet. I&#8217;m going to leave Allison. But I&#8217;m not letting her know. Not until after it&#8217;s done. I can&#8217;t bear the thought of having to tell her. I can&#8217;t bear to look on her face as I tell her. I&#8217;d actually be able to see exactly when her heart shatters into a million pieces, and her world crumbles to dust. And I would be utterly responsible for it.<br />
On Tuesday the 29th, Allison has a night class in French. My brilliant plan [insert scathing sarcasm here] is to drop her off at class, and then empty my stuff from out apartment into a U-Haul truck, and leave the Lower Mainland forever. This is not what I would call an ideal solution. But there isn&#8217;t one available. I don&#8217;t want to leave her high and dry, abandoning her like this, but I need my sanity.<br />
By leaving her like this, I become a coward. I&#8217;m too afraid to see what I do to her. I&#8217;m too frightened to bear the knowledge of destroying a person&#8217;s life. You&#8217;ll note, of course, that I don&#8217;t use the adjective &#8220;innocent&#8221;. Allison is as far from innocent as I can imagine.<br />
It started when I arrived in Vancouver two years ago. I came here, hoping that the relationship Allison and I had started might blossom into something wonderful. Instead, it went sour almost immediately. Allison started manipulating me right from the start. We&#8217;d get into a massive fight where I&#8217;d be blamed for doing something wrong that I didn&#8217;t even know I did. The fight would get to the point where I was furious, and I&#8217;d yell. Allison would then cringe away from me, begging me not to hurt her. I&#8217;d walk away, convinced that this was not going to work. A phone call later, everything was dandy, and we continued.<br />
And so the noose started to form around my neck. I let myself be drawn in by Allison&#8217;s ability to convince me that she needed me, and I needed her. I let myself take the full brunt of her pains &#8212; if she was unhappy, I was made unhappy. I had to make her be happy so I could be happy. Her moods were never private &#8212; if she was upset, she would make sure I knew. Even if it was something as simple as sighing loudly in bed ever few seconds, I always knew when she was dissatisfied with something.<br />
My upbringing was always of concern. Because I was not brought up by Allison&#8217;s mother, I seemed to be inferior. I couldn&#8217;t cook like Allison, I didn&#8217;t clean like Allison, I didn&#8217;t eat like Allison, and I certainly didn&#8217;t watch my money like Allison.<br />
In fact, money was a massive problem with us. I spent a lot of money getting myself up and running here. I moved into an apartment with virtually nothing. I needed things so I could cook and eat. And for that, I got in trouble. A lot of it. I got bawled out. How could I consciably spend over $500 in items for my apartment? What gave me the right to do that? Did I know that Allison&#8217;s entire family didn&#8217;t have that kind of money to spend? Did I not care that they were in unions? Did I not care that my debt was killing her? I let her make me feel like dirt.<br />
Trust was a problem. I trusted her too much, and she never trusted me. Even after she moved in with me in Burnaby, there was no trust. In early August, this got to the point where Allison told me that I would never be fully trusted until there was a ring on her finger. Before me, Allison had claimed she never wanted to get married. I never did &#8212; I didn&#8217;t see any benefit, or any point for that matter. But trust was what I wanted the most, and I was willing to sacrifice my beliefs for her &#8212; I proposed.<br />
Things were great for about a month, until Allison decided to quit her job for another one. The new company pulled a fast one on her, and suddenly Allison was without a job. Most people would shrug their shoulders, and find a new job. But not Allison. Her black-and-white view of right-and-wrong dictated that she get even with the company &#8212; get what she was owed. So I became embroiled in a rather nasty fight for money Allison never earned. It was on a contract that she signed, but had never worked for. She spent months working at making this company pay.<br />
Allison took them to small claims court. This also meant she had to serve the company (specifically the two people she fingered) with court notices. But Allison didn&#8217;t want to &#8212; she made me do it. I panicked (I didn&#8217;t want to get into all this in the first place), and didn&#8217;t hand deliver one of the notices. Allison freaked. On me. It took me down like collapsing brick wall. She made me go back and attempt to make sure that the letter was actually delivered. Before I knew it, we were calling the police and claiming theft.<br />
Then winter set in. Allison, who had to constantly look for work (in order to show to the court that she was actively trying to recover from the situation) became depressed. Things hit bottom in early February of &#8217;99. We got into an argument. Over what specifically, I don&#8217;t remember. It took only a few minutes for Allison to reduce me to a bubbling mass of tear-filled nerves. I was an utter wreck.<br />
I had been very upset for a while, not sure of what I was doing. I didn&#8217;t have the clarity of mind to know what I needed to do, or what I should do. I wish now that I had called *somebody* and been able to tell them what happened. But I didn&#8217;t, and when Allison laid into me that evening, she completely broke me.<br />
Allison then excused herself, saying she was leaving. She got up, but her jacket on, said &#8220;goodbye&#8221; and left the apartment. I was so distraut I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. Before I could even lock the door, it burst open again, and Allison started yelling at me &#8212; &#8220;Are you just going to let me leave?!&#8221; &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you?&#8221;<br />
Then she asked me if I wanted to see her die. She told me I could watch her slit her wrists and watch the blood flow out of her. I couldn&#8217;t have been any more upset. Then she lowered the boom on me: &#8220;Will you die with me?&#8221;<br />
I never recovered from that. I still wake up with nightmares. I still shake at the thought.<br />
And I stayed. I have no idea why.<br />
As a result, I don&#8217;t remember much else from last year. I know I was still mistreated, as I am now. The constant orders (not requests &#8212; she seldom asks, and hardly even says the word &#8220;Please&#8221;), using me as a slave (she rarely offers to get things from the store, and even when I&#8217;m sick she doesn&#8217;t want to do anything), and making me a part of all her misery. Even the simple things degrade me. She holds out her arms (as when preparing to hug someone) when I&#8217;m sitting in a different chair. She doesn&#8217;t get up and come over to me, but gives me hurt and pained looks when I don&#8217;t come to her. I&#8217;ve been reduced to Pavlov&#8217;s Dog.<br />
She exercised control over my life that I only describe as near-totalitarian. She nitpicks everything I do &#8212; makes comments about my Observer&#8217;s Logs to everyone I know. If I don&#8217;t make the corrections, I get in trouble. And in the kitchen, Geoff can do no right. I&#8217;m not fast enough, I&#8217;m not attentive enough, I&#8217;m not good enough. I make a mistake, and I never hear the end of it &#8212; Allison makes a mistake, and I let it slide. Why? Because it&#8217;s not worth getting worked up about. It&#8217;s really not worth it!<br />
Then there&#8217;s my personal time. Allison&#8217;s always on my case about taking courses and meeting new friends. But if I decide I&#8217;m going to stay late with people I work with and have fun, people I already know and could get to know better, I get yelled at. Oh, and if I forget to call and let her know when I&#8217;m coming back, I&#8217;d better be prepared for a good skinning, because that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ll get. Heaven forbid I should be late &#8212; especially around dinner time.<br />
And then there&#8217;s money. I already told you about the time I went to IKEA to get some things so I could live. Well, there&#8217;s the issue of Allison&#8217;s obessiveness with debt &#8212; she won&#8217;t do it, under any circumstanes. Allison never wants to be poor &#8212; it&#8217;s some hang-up from when she was a kid. So of course, she wants to show how she isn&#8217;t poor by living a good lifestyle. She wants all the fine things so she can show off to her friends how well off she is. But if she forgets to pay her credit card by one day, she complete freaks, convinced that her perfect credit rating will crumble instantly.<br />
I&#8217;ve since stopped telling Allison what my credit card bills look like. I&#8217;ve spent so much money trying to keep her happy, I&#8217;m actually ill. I&#8217;ve wasted money on all sorts of things, and I&#8217;m tired of it. I&#8217;m tired of trying to make her happy. I&#8217;m tired of not having money to do the things I want to do, and the time to do them.<br />
With all this, you&#8217;d think that I&#8217;d have left long ago. But I haven&#8217;t. It wasn&#8217;t until I spent an evening talking with Allison&#8217;s best friend that I realized that things were wrong. About two weeks later, I made my decision to leave. Now I&#8217;m just waiting to go. And the waiting is killing me.<br />
<strong>24 February 2000</strong><br />
T minus five days and counting.<br />
On Tuesday, I started preparations. I moved several boxes down to the storage locker, and made sure I cound find everything I wanted. Some parts of the apartment I will not need to look at ever again. I know that what I want isn&#8217;t there. I&#8217;m abandoning a lot of things. I consider it making room to allow myself and my sanity to return.<br />
I&#8217;ve had a minor problem crop up &#8212; Stuart can&#8217;t come to help. His company put him on a high-pressue, short-deadline contract that will keep him in Calgary (and likely his office) until March 8th. It basically prevents him from coming here.<br />
Luckily for me, I&#8217;ve got a backup. I took my friend Greg (one of my co-workers) out the other day, and told him what I was doing and the reasons why. I then asked him to help me. All I wanted was for him to give me a hand emptying the apartment. But he offered to help drive. By lucky chance, Stuart&#8217;s sudden inavailability was negated by my saviour.<br />
The planning is mostly done. I need to change addresses on my bills. Some of them I&#8217;ll change when I get to Calgary &#8212; I don&#8217;t want anything leaking early. This means I won&#8217;t be putting Allison&#8217;s name on the bills until I&#8217;m safely out of the province.<br />
Each and every morning and evening when I&#8217;m walking to or from work, I think about what I&#8217;ll do on Tuesday. I think about how I&#8217;m going to get the truck from U-Haul, how Greg (and whatever other helper I can get) will meet at our apartment and wait for me to leave with Allison, how they&#8217;ll get the keys to the apartment, how they&#8217;ll start while I&#8217;m dropping Allison off at her class, how we&#8217;ll load the truck as quickly as possible, how I&#8217;ll make sure there&#8217;s a taxi to pick Allison up (I&#8217;m not completely heartless), how I&#8217;m going to leave Allison a note (and what that note will say), how I&#8217;m going to mail Allison&#8217;s parents a note (because I really feel I owe it to them), and how much I want to get myself out of this mess.<br />
And I think about what this will do to her.<br />
I&#8217;m going to destroy her life. That much is certain. She&#8217;s based her entire view of the future around me. She expects me to be there for her any time of the day or night. She doesn&#8217;t see this coming, and it&#8217;s going to be the worst possible surprise she could ever imagine. If I&#8217;m lucky, she&#8217;ll just cry. If I&#8217;m unlucky, I&#8217;ll get to carry the knowledge that I drove her to suicide. I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m prepared for any eventuality, but I know that&#8217;s not possible. Reality is always far harsher than your best wishes.<br />
Cathy has been so supportive through all this. Mind you, she&#8217;s been on my case for a while for me to leave. She knows I haven&#8217;t been happy for quite some time. It&#8217;s amazing how someone you hated as a child turns into your biggest supporter. My mother had always claimed that we would be each other&#8217;s best friend when we got older. We thought she was nuts. I guess &#8220;mom knows best&#8221; is right.<br />
Mind you, I&#8217;ve found that most of the people I&#8217;ve talked to are supportive of me leaving, though the reason varies between people. For some, they know it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not happy. For others, it&#8217;s because they know the reason I&#8217;m not happy.<br />
I&#8217;m running out of time. There&#8217;s not enough to do everything I want to do before I leave. I need to finish documentation &#8230; I haven&#8217;t the information or the days to complete it. I want to finish overhauling the intranet &#8230; I simply can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m leaving so many loose strings, I&#8217;m actually embarassed. I had been hoping for a simple and straight-forward exit. But I&#8217;m not getting one.<br />
In fact, I had hoped some time ago to stay here for several years. And by all appearances, that was entirely possible. It was one of the two reasons I felt like I didn&#8217;t want to leave Vancouver. I liked it at Radical. It was a good job, with good people. I was respected and well compensated for my time. But when I came realize I wanted to leave Allison, I knew that I had to leave Radical as well.<br />
You see, I&#8217;m worried about what Allison will do. Based on her general habits, and her previous actions, I&#8217;m certain that I can&#8217;t simply walk away. She&#8217;ll come after me, either to just yell at me, or to physically hurt me. I don&#8217;t know which &#8212; possibly both, I guess. No matter how I look at it, I don&#8217;t want to be around here. It&#8217;s too uncomfortable.<br />
Now for the other reason I kept not wanting to leave. Believe it or not, it was Allison&#8217;s family. Irony of ironies &#8212; I love the family, but can&#8217;t stand the woman I was to marry. From the moment I walked in the door, I was immediately accepted and trusted by her parents. (Well, except for the fact that they wouldn&#8217;t let us sleep in the same room for about a year.) I got along very well with both Randy and Jane (Allison&#8217;s brother and sister). I felt like I was part of the family.<br />
They made it bearable for me to exist here. They made it so I had something to look forward to. And it hurt a lot to realize that I had to betray their trust when I leave Allison.<br />
<strong>26 February 2000</strong><br />
T minus three days, one hour and 10 minutes.<br />
I&#8217;m getting scared. I don&#8217;t know how this is all going to work. I&#8217;ve got some more help moving things out of the apartment, and I&#8217;m going to try for one more person. But it&#8217;s the truck I&#8217;m worried about. According to U-Haul, the only carrier who will do one-way trips to Calgary, there&#8217;s no guarantee that I&#8217;ll be able to get a truck on Tuesday. If not, I&#8217;m in deep trouble. I need a truck. I need the ability fork all my junk into one vehicle, and hit the road.<br />
I haven&#8217;t slept well in days. I&#8217;m always tired. I&#8217;ve been living on Coca Cola for a week, and it&#8217;s causing me to have shaking of the hands &#8230; either that, or it&#8217;s the stress.<br />
We watched &#8220;The Story of Us&#8221; last night. It&#8217;s about a marriage that&#8217;s breaking apart. I supposed to most people it would be a good movie (it actually is, at least I think so). But to me, it was like looking in a mirror, watching my relationship with Allison for the past two years. But my relationship won&#8217;t have the happy ending&#8230;<br />
Well, I&#8217;d better get home. Allison&#8217;s expecting me. I shouldn&#8217;t be late.<br />
<strong>28 February 2000</strong><br />
T minus 30 hours.<br />
Yesterday I spent my last sunny day in Vancouver. I woke up late. We got up slowly, and moved with no intention of amounting to anything useful. The day, predicted as rainy, was in fact sunny and warm (it barely broke into the double-digits, admittedly, but it was still nice).<br />
We played with &#8220;The Sims&#8221; for a while (a new game from Maxis, by the creator of SimCity), then decided that we needed to go out. Rather, *I* decided that we needed to go out. I wanted to experience one more good day in Vancouver.<br />
We walked down to the seawall, and walked over to the False Creek Ferry depot. We walked within metres of where I&#8217;d first told my sister that I was leaving Allison. The sun was bright, the breeze scarcely blowing. The water was clear &#8212; we could easily see the starfish on the bottom. People were out walking, running, biking, wandering. It was a good day.<br />
We took the Ferry over to Granville Island, and proceeded to head into the market. We had our favourite, perogies and cabbage rolls. Our server gave us more than the usual amount of perogies, which was fine because they are tasty. We ate outside, in the sun and fresh air, listening to a trumpeter busking in the courtyard of the market. It was a good day.<br />
The market itself was full of people, all looking and buying. All we got was a container of cottage cheese and some strawberries.<br />
By the time we got home, we were a bit chilled, but otherwise fine. The sun was beginning to set (we&#8217;d headed out late that afternoon), and the temperature began to drop. It was my last day in Vancouver. From there on in, all I would (or will) do is work, entertain Allison, eat, sleep, and pack.<br />
I&#8217;m going to miss this city. I never went swimming at the Aquatic Centre. I never went to the Marine Museum, or to the Space Centre. I didn&#8217;t get to spent spring or summer in the West End. I didn&#8217;t get to play softball again. I never got to go skiing at any of the ski hills in the area. I never got to go to the Mining Museum. I never saw Molly&#8217;s Reach. I will never see Allison&#8217;s family again (yes, this is a regret). I&#8217;m going to miss Radical, and all my coworkers horribly.<br />
Change is never easy.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I get by with a little help from my friends.<br />
In this case, it was Stuart and Therese, two of my oldest and closest friends. I ventured to the wilds of Calgary to say &#8220;Hi&#8221; and check out the sights. Well, at least so far as Calgary has sights&#8230;<br />
The flight left Vancouver at 6:00pm. WestJet is not the most comfortable airline in Canada, but when you&#8217;re travelling a mere hour, comfort is a minor issue. However, when arriving just after 8:00pm (Calgary time), I was realizing just how much a comfortable seat makes a difference. Luckily, Stuart was there to pick me up and whisk me away to a comfortable car.<br />
Calgary was cold. Really cold. About -20 C. Okay, so it&#8217;s like the rest of Canada right now &#8212; I live in BC. If it drops to 5 C people start to think the next Ice Age is coming. I&#8217;m beginning to be that way. I found Calgary quite cold, a little too cold as a matter of fact. My nose hairs froze almost instantly (leaving that rather awkward feeling in your nose), closely followed by my fingers and my feet.<br />
Calgary was under a fair amount of snow. Not as much as they&#8217;d had earlier in the week, but still more than Vancouver had all last year. In a strange way, it was neat to see all that whiteness after so long of green &#8230; that feeling faded soon, however. White&#8217;s kinda &#8230; bland.<br />
We arrived at Chez Therese and Stuart about a half hour after leaving the airport. I hadn&#8217;t seen Therese for over a year &#8212; six hours on New Year&#8217;s Eve 1998. That was it. It was nice to be reunited with old friends again. I was promptly fed a tasty meal of &#8230; actually, I don&#8217;t know what to call it except for hamburger casserole, but with ground turkey instead of beef. It was a good welcome.<br />
[Ed. Note: What I did not originally write in the email was that I told Stuart and Therese that I was leaving Allison and Vancouver. They were the first ones to know (I had only made my mind up on the flight to Calgary). Therese, of course, had to be melodramatic and asked Stuart to pinch her. At first, I thought she was going to try and talk me out of it. I was very relieved when I found that they were not only happy, but excited to know I was getting out. There&#8217;s more on this in the next log entry.]<br />
We talked continuously for what seemed like hours. Now that I think of it, it was hours &#8212; Therese and Stuart both had work the next day, and I had an interview with an Internet startup somewhere in Calgary the next morning. So it was off to bed.<br />
But not off to sleep. Although I suspect Stuart and Therese slept well, I had a minor problem &#8230; Tao and Te, their Siamese cats. Siamese are genetically bred not to sleep when everyone does. And their favourite thing to do when other are sleeping is playing. With ping pong balls. All night.<br />
The next morning, I showered and changed into my interview outfit. Therese and I would then hunker down for the 30 minute trip to the University via the Calgary Transit system. It was then I realized just how much I don&#8217;t like cold weather &#8212; it cut right through my business suit. My thighs froze almost instantly. It was uncomfortable, to say the least. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t long before the bus arrived.<br />
My instructions were simple: Take the bus to the C-Train. (That wasn&#8217;t too hard to do, and I had Therese with me in case I got confused.) Take the C-Train to the Sunnyside stop. Walk west from the Sunnyside to 10th St., and turn left. Walk until I get to Kensington. Turn right, and walk until 14th. Look for the old Bre-X building. Of course, it&#8217;s only known as that by infamy. The sign on it now is &#8220;One Nineteen&#8221;. (Although there is a &#8220;Bro-X Minerals&#8221; in the first floor.)<br />
I nearly froze to death getting there.<br />
The interview was an offshoot of an interview I conducted some weeks ago for an article Allison and I worked on. The idea was, in theory, to get a job with an eCommerce company. The interview was a bit odd &#8212; the three guys at the table literally pulled me apart trying to find out what I knew. It was destined not to be a good lead. (And so I found out today, it didn&#8217;t pan out at all &#8212; I was rejected.)<br />
No loss &#8212; it was, if anything, good experience for interview later on. Allison got a good lead on a job at her old company, which not only looked good, but should pay me more. I still haven&#8217;t heard anything from them, but at the very least, I&#8217;ll be better prepared when I go to see them.<br />
After the interview, I went to track down Stuart&#8217;s office. It wasn&#8217;t quite as cold when I left, so I could at least get there without losing the feeling in my extremities. Finding the building (after having to call Therese to make sure I was at the right building), I found Stuart was still knee-deep in work. I hustled out and off to humour myself for an hour or so.<br />
Calgary has built itself around its harsh weather &#8212; the malls cover almost the entire downtown, and you can get around without having to go outside (at least for any distance). Very convenient. This is particularly interesting around lunch, when all the business towers empty into the food courts. It&#8217;s quite strange to watch the flood of people &#8230; it&#8217;s almost like watching an anthill.<br />
I returned to Stuart&#8217;s office at 1:00 for lunch. We disappeared to some weird place called &#8220;Burger Inn&#8221;. They serve, well, hamburgers. And ostrichburgers. Not to mention buffalo, emu, venison &#8230; basically any kind of meat you can get in the province. Good burgers, though&#8230;<br />
Stuart then passed me off to Therese at the University so he could get back to work. Therese had work to finish, so I just hung around for a while until she was ready to go. Then it was back out into the cold to get to the C-Train again. (At this point, I was ready to flinch every time I went outdoors &#8212; that cold is just brutal. Of course, I&#8217;m probably just turning into your typical Vancouver wimp.)<br />
That evening, we were going to go out with a group of Therese&#8217;s colleagues and friends to go see &#8220;Scream 3&#8221; and then go see a band called &#8220;Plastikman&#8221;. Therese&#8217;s car, which had been having a few problems, only made it a couple of kilometres before Stuart had to pull over. Therese had been telling Stuart for roughly that distance that there was something wrong with the car.<br />
Although I don&#8217;t know exactly what happened, it looked like an electrical problem of some kind. Basically, there wasn&#8217;t enough power to keep the engine running &#8230; something that smells like a bad alternator. Either way, we weren&#8217;t going anywhere. While Stuart tried to get the car to start again, Therese and I attempted to get a hold of their friends and let them know we weren&#8217;t going to make it. We were less than successful.<br />
About an hour after all this started, the CAA truck finally showed up. Because the cab was so small, only one person could fit in with the driver. That person was Stuart. This left Therese and I to hike to the nearest warm place (a Safeway) &#8212; about half a kilometre away. Through shin-deep snow. In the freezing cold. By the time we got there, neither of us could feel our feet, and my ears (now exposed to the cold due to my recent haircut) were about ready to fall off.<br />
We were at the Safeway about 45 minutes before a cab finally showed up to whisk us away (Calgary seems to have a severe shortage of cabs in the winter). By that time Stuart had already returned from dropping the car off.<br />
We returned to Therese and Stuart&#8217;s, where we decided to order pizza and watch a movie. This meant going outside again. And into a car that had no heater. I froze. (As you can tell, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the cold anymore.)<br />
We rented &#8220;The 13th Warrior&#8221;, a movie starring Antonio Banderas, filmed in BC, and based on the Old English epic poem &#8220;Beowulf&#8221;. Despite my degree in English, which involved Old English literature, I completely missed the references. That could also be because the movie sucked.<br />
The next morning, we met Geoff (another one &#8212; it certainly makes for awkward conversations when trying to figure out which Geoff is the subject), Jeanine (this is a total guess on spelling, I probably have it wrong), and Sean for dim sum.<br />
Dim sum is one of life&#8217;s little pleasures. It&#8217;s the sort of thing I&#8217;d love to do on a regular basis &#8230; except every time we try, we always end up not doing it. I don&#8217;t know why, it just seems to end up that way.<br />
After dim sum, we traipsed through a local bakery for the dessert we didn&#8217;t get (the dessert cart mysteriously vanished during our repast), and then headed off to the Eaton&#8217;s Centre. (The Eaton&#8217;s is gone, obviously.) Apparently, it was a good day to buy clothes. Everything was on sale.<br />
Not in a buying mood, I followed our little troupe around the mall, looking for anything that might pique my curiousity. Sadly, the only thing I found was a good deal on a CD I seem to have lost a few years ago. I guess I&#8217;m just not the clothes-buying type of person. But that&#8217;s just me, I guess. I suck at fashion (I need other people to dress me), and can&#8217;t buy decent-looking clothes to save my life.<br />
On the bright side, I don&#8217;t spend a lot of money on clothes.<br />
Returning home, Stuart, Therese, and I sat down to watch &#8220;The 13th Warrior&#8221;. Therese had passed out about 15 minutes into the movie the previous night, Stuart joining her about half-way through. So we watched the movie from near its start.<br />
Then it was off to dinner and a movie. We went to Red Devil, a small chain that&#8217;s now in Calgary. It&#8217;s a barbeque joint, priding itself on hot sauces. Overall, pretty good food &#8212; really good calamari (and I&#8217;m not a fan of calamari). We were there for about two hours, laughing, drinking, and eating. It was almost like old times (except that we were missing a few others).<br />
Then it was off to our entertainment for the evening. We opted to see Leo&#8217;s newest flick, &#8220;The Beach&#8221;. Yeah, I know, what possessed us to see that? Well, strange as it may seem, it&#8217;s actually not that bad a movie. First off, this was done by Danny Boyle, who brought us such cinematic gems as &#8220;Trainspotting&#8221;, &#8220;Life Less Ordinary&#8221;, and &#8220;Shallow Grave&#8221;. Unfortunately, this movie didn&#8217;t start getting interesting until Leo&#8217;s character started losing his mind.<br />
Mind you, that was the point &#8212; it&#8217;s very similar to &#8220;Apocalypse Now&#8221;, and features many references to the movie. We were amazed at the number of people who really didn&#8217;t seem to get that point.<br />
Heathens.<br />
We started late the next day. Really late. It was Sunday, and darn it, we were sleeping in. When we finally got ourselves up and running, we went out for lunch to Arden&#8217;s. As in Jan Arden, the singer. She owns a restaurant in Calgary. It&#8217;s quite good, really, and showcases a lot of tasty fare. Best philly cheese steak sandwich I&#8217;ve had since the Copper Penny in Kingston. (Of course, there&#8217;s also Dix here in Vancouver, and it&#8217;s also really good.)<br />
After lunch, Stuart and Therese dropped me off at my relatives, where I could have a chat (albeit a brief one) with my Aunt and Uncle. Sadly, Uncle Mike was off playing basketball, so I was only able to speak with my Aunt Brenda. Our meeting was short-lived, however, as I had to get to the airport to catch my plane. Therese and Stuart reappeared not long after.<br />
The flight back was a little more pleasant than the flight out, although I&#8217;m not sure why. Probably because I was returning to Vancouver. It&#8217;s always nice to return here. It&#8217;s a lovely view from 20,000 feet up.<br />
I&#8217;m home again, and quite comfortable where I am. The sun is out, the birds are chirping, and the only snow is a few hundred feet up a mountain.<br />
I like it that way.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a busy beginning to the year. I think it&#8217;s just a sign of things to come.<br />
You&#8217;ve probably been wondering where I&#8217;ve been &#8212; didn&#8217;t I send all those logs during Christmas? Where are all the ones from January? Well, truth be known, I simply didn&#8217;t get around to them.<br />
Like I said, it&#8217;s been a busy beginning to the year. Upon returning to the Lower Mainland, we had to take Allison to the hospital again. This time it was for a possible infection in her surgical wound, which we had noticed on New Year&#8217;s Day. Allison was also beginning to run a temperature, so the viral experts wanted to keep an eye on her. As it turns out, the panic was for not &#8212; she had the flu. A rather nasty case of it, too. Luckily, Lorna graciously came over and kept an eye on her (and cleaned our apartment stem to stern) while I went to work.<br />
The following week, I started my night course. Once a week for two and a half hours, I go to SFU&#8217;s downtown campus for a class on &#8220;Concepts and Practices of Technical Communication&#8221;. Sound like a beginner&#8217;s level course? It is. My manager suggested it. I feel insulted. I slept for the first three classes, and it was only with the help of caffeine that I&#8217;ve made it through the others. I&#8217;m learning virtually nothing and I&#8217;m the youngest in the class.<br />
Which brings me to my impending change in profession. Technical writing is &#8230; uh &#8230; technical, and &#8230; important &#8230; ah, who am I kidding? It&#8217;s boring me to tears. I can&#8217;t stand it anymore. I want out. Luckily for me, I&#8217;ve had side projects going to keep my skills up in the web. It seems like I&#8217;ve got the right skills at the right time.<br />
I&#8217;m declaring to my manager today that I want out of technical writing. I&#8217;m hoping to become the new web guru &#8217;round these here parts. We don&#8217;t have one, and as recent history seems to be indicating, we could use one. There&#8217;s only one issue &#8212; whether the company thinks this is a good idea.<br />
If Radical chooses &#8216;no&#8217;, I&#8217;m in a little hot water. It basically means that I either stick to the old tried and true (i.e. what I&#8217;m doing now), or I bail out of the company and go somewhere else. Now, if you&#8217;re Radical, and you just denied me my change in career, how long do you think it&#8217;ll be before I leave? There&#8217;s a huge can of worms here just waiting to be opened. (And I just found out that my execution has been stayed &#8217;til this afternoon, when my manager finally gets in.)<br />
I&#8217;m not the only one looking for a change. Last Thursday, Jane dropped by for a brief visit &#8230; a visit with a purpose. She was hoping to talk with a company in North Vancouver about a Customer Service Representative position. The company is Hospitality Careers Online, and they provide a list of jobs in the hospitality industry across North America. Jane had already talked to them over the phone, but her current job called her in on the day she was supposed to clinch the position. So she came over to finish the job (no pun intended).<br />
She called the company early the next morning, but couldn&#8217;t get an interview until 5:30 that evening. Allison and I would pick her up from North Vancouver and take her to the ferry so she could get back to Nanaimo to get to work the following day. Jane performed admirably at the interview, telling them exactly what she wanted and how she felt about moving to North Vancouver. Allison was a bit surprised that Jane had said she wanted to move to North Vancouver to be closer to a good snowboarding hill. No worries there &#8212; the company&#8217;s owner moved there for precisely the same reason. Saturday morning, we learned that Jane got the job.<br />
Last week, Allison took her first night course of the year. She&#8217;s taking French lessons at the Francophone Institute on West 7th. First off, she wanted to take a course in something, so she had something to look forward to each week. Having the ability to improve her French was the sort of thing she wanted.<br />
So three weeks ago, I took her over for an entrance exam, where one of the Institute&#8217;s staff asked her a few questions &#8230; in French. This, unfortunately, was Allison&#8217;s weak point &#8212; she has problems &#8220;hearing&#8221; French. She can read it and speak it quite well, but that wasn&#8217;t the test. As a result, she ended up a level lower than she should be, as was proved in her first class last week.<br />
The amusing part was that prior to her class, Allison was very nervous about being out of her league, that she would be the worst in the class. She couldn&#8217;t have been further from the truth. She&#8217;s sticking it out though, mostly because it lets her practice speaking and listening to French in a comfortable atmosphere, and she&#8217;s already made friends.<br />
Speaking of friends, Stuart appeared here two weeks ago. I got a call on the 28th where an all-too-familiar voice said: &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;d like to order a pizza.&#8221; It was Stuart, informing me that he was coming to Vancouver to take pictures at a private school. He was coming on a short-notice photo shoot for a client, which meant he was also coming alone &#8212; Therese was staying in Calgary.<br />
We didn&#8217;t see Stuart until after 6pm on Sunday. I picked him up at the corner of Davie and Granville, so he wouldn&#8217;t get turned around on my directions (which I was having severe problems making simple, for some silly reason). We went to dinner and played video games at Playdium. It was almost like old times.<br />
The next day we did lunch, prior to his return to Calgary. It was then I concluded that I was going to Calgary myself &#8212; I had to see my friends again. It&#8217;s been over a year since I last saw Therese, and I miss her dearly (as I do all my friends). I&#8217;m going on Thursday evening.<br />
After a lot of debate, we finally bought a new computer. This was the first computer I bought (or at least had a part in buying) that didn&#8217;t come from the store I worked at. It was from a place called Addax in Richmond that Allison recommended. It was a good deal, and allows Allison to work a bit more efficiently than before. It also gave us a good reason to buy SimCity 3000. With luck, we&#8217;ll turn the old computer into a Linux server. That&#8217;s a project on my lengthy list of projects.<br />
I guess that brings me right up to today. Not much else going on, although you can expect another log this time next week.<br />
Until then&#8230;</p>

		<p>T minus 206 days until W-Day.<br />
And so the new year begins &#8212; the last of the second millennium, Ado Domini (or Common Era, if you prefer). It&#8217;s been a rough year for us, with many events having rocked our little world time and time again. Here&#8217;s the brief synopsis of the past year:<br />

		<p>The clock, as they say, is ticking.<br />
In a few short hours, the last few seconds of 1999 will disappear somewhere just off the coast of New Zealand, and we&#8217;ll start to find out what we&#8217;re in for. Some believe it&#8217;s the end of the world, others believe it&#8217;s the end of our civilisation, and others believe it&#8217;s the end of the year. (Allison thinks that maniacs who spell &#8220;civilization&#8221; *incorrectly* (see the *correct* British spelling in the previous sentence) will be the death of us.)<br />
I believe it&#8217;s the beginning of the future.<br />
Sure, we may lose power for a few hours if something goes wrong, but that&#8217;s not going to wipe us all out. Rather, it&#8217;ll be the militants running amuck with a few tonnes of nitroglycerine. They&#8217;re the ones creeping me out. In many ways, I&#8217;m quite glad I&#8217;m sitting here in Nanaimo, away from the big cities. The worst that could happen is that I get stranded here when BC Ferries shuts down due to some unforseen navigation problem.<br />
Predictions are in order for such an auspicious occasion, and I find it hard to pass them up. So here&#8217;s what I think will happen tonight:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few places will lose power, either by some poor programming, by complete fluke, or through some maniac&#8217;s planning</li>
<li>Several thousand people will at some point lose their lives (this will come true regardless of what happens, based purely on the human death rate); whether this number spikes due to artificial designs (see the above-mentioned maniac) remains to be seen &#8212; expect several deaths due to drunk drivers</li>
<li>Hospitals around the world will be deluged by people convinced the world is going to end; there may also be a rush if the above artifical spike occurs</li>
<li>The banks will go on, as will your bank balances</li>
<li>Your computer will still start in the morning, provided you have electricity</li>
</ul>
<p>And my most Earth-shattering prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ll all be disappointed when nothing happens</li>
</ul>
<p>Leave it to the media to psyche this New Year&#8217;s way out of proportion, including the addition of the moniker &#8220;Millennium&#8221;. This is NOT the new Millennium, folks &#8212; that&#8217;s next year. (Don&#8217;t believe me? Answer this question: Was there a Year 0? Answer: No. Result, the decades actually *end* with &#8216;0&#8217;, such as 1950, 1970, and yes, 2000.)<br />
Oh yes, and unless Nostradamus&#8217; predictions come true in the next 24 hours (and I doubt they will [insert sound of me knocking on wood]), there will be no Earth-shattering earthquake that sends us BCers into the drink. (If not, I&#8217;ll have a *really* good story for you in about 24 hours or so.)<br />
So, with that, I leave you to the Most Overblown Festivities of the past Millennium (and yes, that you can actually bank on &#8212; there won&#8217;t be anything worse than this year), and I hope to see you all in the New Year.<br />
Provided the Earth doesn&#8217;t end, of course.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, another Christmas has come and (almost) gone. It was an unusual Christmas for me, mostly because things have changed. My family is bigger than it was, and I&#8217;ve got a few more traditions to start remembering.<br />
The first of these traditions is waking up at 8:00am. Around here, Christmas starts a bit earlier than in Oakville. This is primarily due to Mr. Collins, who was up at 5:00am, waiting for Christmas to begin. His energy certainly makes Christmas interesting.<br />
Collins Christmases are big events &#8230; much bigger than Sowrey Christmases (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with either of them). Waking up to a Collins Christmas means wading through to some place on the couch where you can spend a comfortable hour or two unwrapping presents. It reminds me of my childhood (no doubt in part to Mr. Collins&#8217; enthusiasm).<br />
Even the practice of opening a gift on Christmas Eve continues here. It&#8217;s a practice we Sowreys gave up a few years ago (I don&#8217;t even remember when), so it was a little strange to open a gift last night. But it really prepares you for the next morning.<br />
Generousity is the word around here. In fact, &#8220;give until it hurts&#8221; comes to mind. Over the course of the past 14 hours, I have received the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 CD: Harry Connick Jr. &#8211; When My Heart Finds Christmas (from my parents)</li>
<li>1 DVD: Saving Private Randy Special Edition (from the Collins)</li>
<li>1 Penguin Shaker (I&#8217;ll get back to this in a moment)</li>
<li>2 packs: Ferrero Rocher (3 chocolates to a pack) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Terry&#8217;s Chocolate Orange (Collins)</li>
<li>1 stick: deodorant (Collins)</li>
<li>2 rolls: 100 ASA film (Collins)</li>
<li>1 CD: Will Smith &#8211; Willennium (from Jane)</li>
<li>1 pack: Life Savers &#8211; Sweet Story Book (Collins)</li>
<li>1 pack: Life Savers &#8211; Night Before Christmas (Collins)</li>
<li>1 book: Tom Clancy &#8211; Net Force (from my Nana)</li>
<li>1 bottle: Body Shop shampoo (Collins)</li>
<li>1 bottle: Body Shop shower gel (Collins)</li>
<li>1 bar: glycerine soap (Collins)</li>
<li>1 train whistle (sounds like a real whistle, too!) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Reach toothbrush (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Orange Crush(R) candy cane (Collins)</li>
<li>1 homemade orange bath balm/bomb (Collins)</li>
<li>1 feather duster (I think this was a hint) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 pack: Hershey Chocolate Storybook (Collins)</li>
<li>1 book: The Idiot&#8217;s Guide to Personal Finance in your 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s for Canadians (from my sister)</li>
<li>1 book: The World Encyclopedia of Beer (from Allison)</li>
<li>1 sweater: beige with striping (Allison)</li>
<li>1 sweater: light green (Allison)</li>
<li>1 shirt: button-down plaid (Allison)</li>
<li>1 shirt: funky psychedelic black and white (Collins)</li>
<li>1 game: Motorcycle racing (from the Vailmonts)</li>
<li>1 set: bar tools, including bottle opener and corkscrew (from the Vailmonts)</li>
</ul>
<p>That was just me. (Needless to say, I&#8217;m really glad we brought the car.) Oh, and before your eyes bug out from the length of the above list, I would like to direct you to one little detail: a lot of the stuff on that list is &#8220;small&#8221; stuff, such as candy and books.<br />
Then there was the &#8220;collective&#8221;: Allison and I. Together we received:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 bagel-sized toaster (Vailmonts)</li>
<li>1 pizza stone with cutter and lifter (Collins)</li>
<li>1 spaghetti pot (Collins)</li>
<li>1 set: chip bag clips (Collins)</li>
<li>1 set: matching bathroom towels (Collins)</li>
<li>1 game: Sim Theme Park (Randy)</li>
<li>1 pastry blender (non-electric) (Collins)</li>
<li>3 tins: Misty Mountain Chocolate Paté (Collins)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to list Allison&#8217;s gifts &#8230; it&#8217;s already too much stuff. But like I said before: &#8220;Give until it hurts.&#8221; After this Christmas, Allison and I are going to make a donation to charity to compensate for the abundance of gifts. We are certainly thankful, and want to share thanks with others less fortunate than ourselves.<br />
Now, back to that Penguin Shaker. It seems that Santa made a visit last night that I wasn&#8217;t aware of (my Santa was very good at hiding things so I couldn&#8217;t see them packed into the car). I apparently made her, er, his &#8220;nice boy list&#8221;, and was therefore the lucky recipient of a Penguin Shaker.<br />
What&#8217;s a Penguin Shaker? Glad you asked. (Incidentally, if you haven&#8217;t already guessed, this gets my CGOTY award (Cool Gift Of The Year). Back in the 30&#8217;s after prohibition was lifted, there was a big trend to martinis. The entire movement spawned a style that included penguins (tuxedos; ice). Thus was born the penguin-shaped martini shaker. The basic shape is of a martini shaker, with two wings, and a beak. The beak has a plug at the end that (when unscrewed) acts as a spout; a built-in filter prevents the ice from coming out. It&#8217;s silver-plated and utterly gorgeous.<br />
Following the unwrapping, we proceeded to breakfast, courtesy of Master Chef Randy. Then it was helping Mrs. Collins prepare the evening&#8217;s feast of roast beast. (Okay, turkey, but the Dr. Seuss in me was yelling to get out.) I spent a large portion of the afternoon chopping.<br />
When the rest of the family arrived this evening, we exchanged a few more gifts, and then proceeded to dinner. Not much different than a Sowrey Christmas dinner, except that it&#8217;s a lot quieter here. (Those of us who remember the Sowrey/Sinnott dinners will remember the struggle to gain control of the table&#8217;s conversation.)<br />
After dinner, we all broke up into various conversations. Allison adjourned downstairs for a while to use Randy&#8217;s PlayStation, where Allison totally wiped the walls with me. Allison is the video game equivalent of a pool shark &#8212; she starts off making you feel good, and then cleans your clock. I lost a few layers of skin (not to mention several notches on Ye Olde Ego Meter) when she trounced me 12-0 on Triple Play 98.<br />
I hate sports games.<br />
Okay, so I&#8217;m a poor loser. I get frustrated easily. I like being able to do *something* other than *nothing*. That&#8217;s when I get labelled &#8220;sore loser&#8221;. Things I need to work on for my New Year&#8217;s Resolution, I guess.<br />
Anyway, that&#8217;s a Collins Christmas for you. &#8216;Tis time for me to consider getting ready for tomorrow &#8230; who know&#8217;s what it will bring?<br />
Merry Ho-Ho!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8216;Twas the night before Christmas,<br />
And all through the house,<br />
Not a creature was stirring,<br />
&#8216;Cause they were all at the hospital.<br />
Well, briefly anyway.<br />
Our evening was off to a startled start, after Allison required immediate medical attention. This goes back to last Tuesday, when Allison had to have minor emergency surgery to eliminate some major pain. The incision she received was not sutured closed (as per the type of surgery).<br />
This evening, it gave her a bit of trouble. Allison had been instructed to visit Emergency in the event her wound acted up. As it stands, it was a normal (in the sense that most people who get that kind of surgery often have some kind of trouble) and we went home.<br />
Then it was off to Allison&#8217;s grandparents for the traditional Christmas Eve visit. This, of course, is a new thing for me. I&#8217;ve never been through a Collins (or Vailmont) Christmas before &#8212; I really didn&#8217;t know what to expect.<br />
Singing. I should have seen it coming.<br />
Carols, to many of which I have since forgotten the words; some I&#8217;d never even heard before. Mrs. Collins and Grandma Vailmont were belting out the majority of the lyrics, although we had a small argument about the words to &#8220;Frosty the Snowman&#8221;.<br />
Tomorrow is my first Christmas away from my family. So yes, it does hurt a little. My parents and my sister aren&#8217;t by my side (or me by theirs). And due to Allison&#8217;s aforementioned surgery, we won&#8217;t see them this holiday season at all.<br />
Originally, we had planned to visit Florida on vacation, and would spend some time with them. However, Allison&#8217;s doctor has effectively forbade her from travelling for six weeks (now five). So we had to cancel our flight. Needless to say, I&#8217;m really glad that for the first time, I bought flight insurance.<br />
At least we could travel to the Island, even if we had to sit in the ferry lineup for (are you ready for this?) four hours. And we were there early.<br />
Which reminds me of a detail I keep forgetting. Many of you have wondered when we&#8217;re getting married. You know that we got engaged, but the date kept changing. It&#8217;s official: 26 August 2000. The wheels are in motion. So why does taking the ferry remind me of the wedding? Those of you who will be driving will want reservations so you don&#8217;t have to experience sitting in a lineup for hours on end. It&#8217;s particularly bad in the summer.<br />
Anyway, Christmas is fast approaching. But I&#8217;m doing just fine. Sure, I miss my family, but I&#8217;ve got an extended one here that cares for me. It&#8217;s great to feel wanted, particularly after years of making myself feel otherwise.<br />
So for those of you who get this on Christmas Day, I wish you a very Merry Christmas (or Happy Holidays, depending on which you prefer). For the rest of you, I hope you had a great time.<br />
Expect more within 24 hours&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s nothing better than seeing the look of complete terror upon someone&#8217;s face. Especially if you know there&#8217;s a benevolent force behind it. Such as with a surprise party&#8230;<br />
Allison&#8217;s birthday was on Sunday past. And I wanted to make it something special.<br />
So at the beginning of November, I started contacting her friends, seeing who I could get to come out and scare the bejeezus out of my fiancée. I knew that I had to start early, because it takes a while to plan out all the little details. And it doesn&#8217;t matter how straight-forward something seems &#8212; there are *always* little details.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d organised a surprise party was when my close friends Stuart and Therese announced they were moving to Calgary. I wanted to give them a farewell present, by showing them how much their friends would miss them. The party was as much for me as it was for them&#8230;<br />
Planning it had been a nightmare &#8230; the logistics were murder. While Therese and Stuart were wandering about Europe, I had been pulling together their friends (with the help of Therese&#8217;s friend Rachel and Stuart&#8217;s friend Jay) and planning out all the details. How?<br />
Rule #1 when planning a surprise party: Get the parents involved.<br />
Why? Simple: If you don&#8217;t tell the parents, they&#8217;ll inevitably screw up your plans. Not intentionally, mind you, but they&#8217;ll do something that will make your well-laid plans worth sqwat. (Yes, &#8220;sqwat&#8221;.) So, if you get the parents involved with the process, you don&#8217;t have to worry about things backfiring on you.<br />
That&#8217;s how I succeeded with Stuart and Therese&#8217;s party &#8230; and that&#8217;s how I succeeded with Allison&#8217;s party. The best part is, most parents are clever &#8212; they&#8217;ll suggest good ideas without you have to tell them what to do. In the case of Allison&#8217;s parents, they invited Allison over to Nanaimo for her birthday. This left our apartment open.<br />
So brought about the second problem: How to get people into our apartment to surprise Allison. This took a lot longer than I thought it would, and the ultimate solution was so simplistic I had to kick myself for not thinking of it earlier. Keys. Cut a spare set of keys, and leave them with a friend.<br />
Then it was setting up a decorator, and making sure that our Key Master would arrive before everyone else. Where we would go for dinner &#8230; even a theme for the evening.<br />
But above all else, the hardest thing to do was keep Allison in the dark. She&#8217;s a smart cookie, and it&#8217;s really hard to keep things from her. Especially when it comes to her birthday. Luckily for me, Allison&#8217;s parents were running a good cover for me.<br />
We left on Friday the 3rd, catching the late ferry to Nanaimo. This gave me enough time to clean up the bedrooms. We did this under the guise of not having enough time to clean before Allison&#8217;s aunt appeared on Monday for a visit. (I hadn&#8217;t asked her aunt to come the day after Allison&#8217;s birthday as an added distraction &#8230; it just kinda worked that way.)<br />
But we didn&#8217;t get everything. Allison&#8217;s insistence that we leave negated any argument I could have to clean the kitchen table. I didn&#8217;t want to have papers all over it when her friends showed up.<br />
The wonders of today&#8217;s modern technology no longer amaze me &#8230; I use them with gusto. I made several calls over my cell phone to Michelle (our Key Master) and begged her to clean off the kitchen table before people started to show up.<br />
(There&#8217;s always one thing that doesn&#8217;t go quite right.)<br />
Allison&#8217;s family birthday party was the next day, the 4th. This amounted to a wonderful dinner of salmon, which Allison had asked for. Also on the menu was chocolate cake. This was no ordinary chocolate cake, mind you &#8212; this was the King/Queen of Chocolate Cakes. It was called something like Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chip with Chocolate Whipped Chocolate Filling, or something like that.<br />
It was evil.<br />
In a chocolatey good way, that is. I have never, ever has such a devilishly good chocolate cake in my life. (I&#8217;m actually beginning to salivate, just thinking about it.) I can&#8217;t even begin to describe what was in this thing &#8230; all I know is that it was really, REALLY good.<br />
The next day, we were to leave on the 1:00pm ferry. We would arrive in Horseshoe Bay around 3:00pm, and back at our apartment around 3:30. We would talk, chat, whatever for about two hours, and then go to dinner.<br />
That was the plan. But plans have a way of not working exactly as planned.<br />
The ferry was at 12:30, not 1:00pm.<br />
I started to panic a little.<br />
It was a fast ferry. We would arrive nearly an hour before we were supposed to.<br />
I started to panic a lot.<br />
Miracles of modern technology. I called Michelle, and let her know that things were not as well-planned as I had hoped. We tried to figure out what I could do to stall. I had suggested taking Allison to lunch, but she wanted to eat something on the ferry &#8230; that ruled out lunch at the other end. I couldn&#8217;t take the long way home, as it would make her suspicious. Feigning car trouble wasn&#8217;t even a thought &#8212; BCAA would put an end to that right quick.<br />
Then Allison proposed the solution herself &#8212; she wanted to go to IKEA. That would blow an hour and a half, easily.<br />
So it was with much relief that we bypassed our apartment completely and went directly to IKEA. It was a failed mission, in that respect &#8212; the chair covers we had gone looking for were not to be found. IKEA didn&#8217;t carry them in the style we thought they would. We headed home, Allison a little apprehensive about what I had planned for her.<br />
When we arrived (at nearly 4:30, about an hour late because of nightmarish traffic going back), I made sure to grab all the bags, thus tying up my hands so I couldn&#8217;t open the door. No, it&#8217;s hardly chivalrous. but I had to make sure that Allison was the first into the apartment. As we passed the security camera, I looked, waved, and smiled. Because I knew that the 12 people sitting in our living room were watching Channel 59 &#8212; the security camera channel. They knew we were there.<br />
The elevator was a bit slow, by my heart was racing. It was part anticipation, and part realising that maybe this wasn&#8217;t such a good idea. But it was too late, so I concentrated on the anticipation. The hard part was not showing it.<br />
The elevator took forever to finally deposit us on the 6th floor. I exited first, but let Allison lead the way. As we got to the door, I saw that our weekend paper was still wedged in the mail slot &#8212; our awaiting guests had not removed it. I was excited beyond repair. Allison had no clue what was about to happen.<br />
She got in, remarked that the bathroom door was closed (our friends had tossed their shoes in there). The lights were off and it was dark inside, which was good because if we could see, Allison would have seen some of the snacks left on the counter in our kitchen. But she didn&#8217;t see it. (Mind you, Allison saw the extra jackets in the closet, and *still* didn&#8217;t clue in.)<br />
Then it came. A giggle. From someone in the living room.<br />
Allison gasped. Someone was in the apartment. Someone had broken in, and they were still there! As the onset of sheer terror was about to take effect, a very loud and resounding cry was heard (probably through the entire building): &#8220;SURPRISE!&#8221;<br />
Several camera flashes went off. I&#8217;m told the pictures are priceless.<br />
I nearly fell over laughing. Yes, I&#8217;m cruel. I admit it. It was mostly from pure relief that things worked out, after all. (Although for another 20 minutes or so, I was still a bit edgy, wondering if Allison was all right with everything.)<br />
The group went out to dinner at a restaurant not far from our apartment. Wasn&#8217;t the best overall venue, I&#8217;ll admit, but it was the best choice given the size of our party. The place would probably be more interesting later in the evening.<br />
After dinner, most people went their separate ways. (It was a Sunday night, after all, and many people had to go to work the next day.) But Michelle (our Key Bearer), Mike (her husband), and Tyler stuck around. It seemed that there were other things in the evening that I had not planned.<br />
The evening became organic, developing its own events as we went along. We started off at Commodore Lanes, with some five pin bowling. I&#8217;ve discovered how to beat Allison in five pin: Get drunk. Both of us. Her bowling average goes way down, and mine goes way up. (Otherwise, Allison is virtually unbeatable in five pin.) The five of us had a grand old time being really lousy at many things. Especially table hockey. I&#8217;ve always been a lousy player. And foosball. I got creamed at that.<br />
After our bowling excursion, we ended up at Death By Chocolate on Burrard. One of us mentioned that it was Allison&#8217;s birthday. When her dessert showed up, it had a candle on it. Our server just stood there, waiting. Finally, she said: &#8220;C&#8217;mon folks, work with me here.&#8221; We sang Happy Birthday, and indulged in really bad things for us to eat&#8230;<br />
The day so ended as we headed home. Overall, it was a good day, all stress aside. Now I just have to figure out how to outdo myself next year.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, this was certainly a learning experience. Last week, I sent out a survey (sent to me by a friend) that lets people know how much they know about you. It&#8217;s quite informative. After receiving a couple of responses, I thought I&#8217;d compile them. Some are pretty funny, depending on how you know me. Some are very accurate. These are *completely* anonymous (and in random order), so don&#8217;t be worried that I might single you out.<br />
I started off with the following lyric:</p>
<blockquote><p>Run my name through your computer,<br />
Mention me in passing to your college tutor,<br />
Check my records, check my facts,<br />
Check if I&#8217;ve paid my income tax,<br />
Roll over ev&#8217;rythin&#8217; in my CV,<br />
But you&#8217;ll still know nothing &#8217;bout me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of you guessed it right &#8212; the author in question is Sting. Specifically, the lyric is from &#8220;Nothing &#8216;Bout Me&#8221;, the last track on &#8220;Ten Summoner&#8217;s Tales&#8221; (released 1993).<br />
And so, on with the results! Any comments I supply will appear in &#8216;[]&#8217; brackets.<br />
&#8212;<br />
1. My name:<br />
The real answer is, duh, &#8220;Geoff Sowrey&#8221;. Most of the results were correct. There were a few oddities, such as &#8220;Geoff Sowery&#8221; [note the slight misspelling of the last name] and &#8220;Goff Sowrey&#8221; [note the *intentional* misspelling of my first name]. But otherwise it&#8217;s good.<br />
2. Where did we meet?:<br />
There is obviously no right answer for this one. I met a lot of you in lots of strange and interesting places, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>High school</li>
<li>University of Waterloo, Village Two Residence, South A floor, TV   lounge</li>
<li>High school. Chris&#8217; and my birthday parties</li>
<li>Gah&#8230; University of Waterloo, South A.</li>
<li>235 Gordon Street, Guelph, most likely at a party, oui?</li>
<li>University of Waterloo (more specific?  Umm, camping?)</li>
<li>Arkillago [aka Arkipelago]</li>
<li>113 George Street, Toronto, Ontario [aka Arkipelago]</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Take a stab at my middle name..:<br />
This was a good one. I didn&#8217;t realise how few people knew my middle name. It&#8217;s fairly uncommon (or at least it was until shows such as &#8220;Due South&#8221; and &#8220;ER&#8221; made it a little more mainstream): &#8220;Benton&#8221;. A couple surveys had correct answers. The rest believed it was one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert</li>
<li>propellerhead [??]</li>
<li>Son of Worf [more like a nickname from university]</li>
<li>Patrick</li>
<li>Archibald [this submitter did quickly follow up with the correct name]</li>
<li>Edward</li>
</ul>
<p>4. How long have you known me?:<br />
I&#8217;ve known some of you a very long time (some of you receiving this who didn&#8217;t do the survey have known me since the moment I was born &#8212; Hi Mom! &#8212; some of you not quite as long, but almost). The survey respondants gave me a range of between two and 13 years. One answer was fairly specific: &#8220;8yrs 2mths 7 days&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;m beginning to feel a little older now&#8230;<br />
5. How well do you know me?:<br />
Okay, this is totally subjective. How do you determine how well you know someone? You may know someone quite well, and then they move away or go to school. Suddenly, you don&#8217;t think you know them as well as you did. Things change&#8230;<br />
The respondants were all over the board on this. Some claimed they didn&#8217;t know me well at all (which is to be expected) to knowing me quite well. Oddly enough, no-one claimed to know me well enough to say I was &#8220;predictable&#8221;. I guess that means I&#8217;m doing something right for a change&#8230;<br />
6. Do I smoke?:<br />
Everyone had the right answer on this. However, I will quote one of them, because I thought it was appropriate: &#8220;dear god no&#8221;. One of the respondants did have a good point, though: &#8220;Don&#8217;t think so, then again, you didn&#8217;t drink either.&#8221;<br />
7. Do I believe in God?:<br />
Okay, here&#8217;s a touchy subject if I ever heard it. But I&#8217;m not keen on starting any fires that might take time to extinguish, so I&#8217;m just going to say: If you don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t worry. I don&#8217;t get offended easily. But I do have to quote a reply, it&#8217;s just too good: &#8220;someone has to be held reponsible for creating you&#8221;.<br />
8. What was your first impression when you first saw me?:<br />
This was a good one. This is where the true me starts to show through. Okay, you can all stop laughing now&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>That guy is a looney</li>
<li>What&#8217;s with the sandals?</li>
<li>Son of Worf [just remember me with a beard and long hair]</li>
<li>shy, eager to be friendly</li>
<li>Loves computers.</li>
<li>loud [no comments from the peanut gallery, please]</li>
<li>what a spaz!</li>
<li>very intelligent person, with a few quirks [a *few*?]</li>
<li>looks friendly, not like that scary Justin guy or that shifty little   Jim, and he doesn&#8217;t smell as bad as that Rob guy.</li>
</ul>
<p>9. My age?:<br />
My age (current) is 27 years, 4 months, and 9 days. However, I&#8217;ll take 27 as the answer. A couple put down 26 [thanks for making me feel a little younger], two put down 28 [close, but no banana], and one thought I was &#8220;late gen X&#8221; [AIIEEEEEE! I could be as old as 38!].<br />
10. Birthday?:<br />
The correct answer is 16 July 1972 (I will accept July 16 1972, of course). Some responses claimed it was &#8220;July&#8221; [close enough], &#8220;sometime in the summer&#8221; [sorry, but Alex Trebek would ask you to be more specific], and &#8220;you have one each year&#8221; [doesn&#8217;t everyone?].<br />
11. Color hair?:<br />
Officially, brown. Every response was correct. Luckily for you folks, I haven&#8217;t taken to dying my hair.<br />
Yet.<br />
12. Color eyes?:<br />
Allison tells me they&#8217;re green. I always thought they were kinda bluish. I just stared in the mirror. They&#8217;re kinda greeny. Heck, *I* don&#8217;t know what colour my eyes are. So I really don&#8217;t mind that the replies varied from brown to hazel to blue to green. (Yes, there is at least one person who agrees with Allison.)<br />
13. Tall / average / short / fat / average / thin?:<br />
Most of the answers were &#8220;average / average&#8221;. I guess that was to be expected&#8230;<br />
14. Do I have any siblings?:<br />
One. A sister, Cathy. Most were right (although only a couple knew her name), a few got this wrong.<br />
15. (If opposite sex) Have you ever had a crush on me?: (If same sex) Have you ever been jealous of me?:<br />
This was one of the few questions I was hoping for good answers. My ego running wild, I guess. Either way, all but three respondants completely shot me down (thanks, guys). Apparently, I&#8217;ve never been the sort to attract others &#8230; the nearest I got to others having a crush on me was &#8220;officially, no&#8221; and &#8220;A crush no, but I would say we use to have a close bond&#8221;. Only one of the same sex was ever jealous of me. Oh, and there was that one joker who *had* to write: &#8220;(Ha, ha, ha, ha!)&#8221; [insert sound of ego deflating].<br />
16. Whats one of my favorite thing to do?:<br />
Again, some pretty strange responses here. People have some pretty interesting ideas of what my favourite things are. (Everyone knows it&#8217;s bright paper packages tied up with string&#8230;) Answers included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer stuff</li>
<li>bike really long distances once in a while</li>
<li>make trouble with Stuart with Chris</li>
<li>Play on computer, write, eat ice cream.</li>
<li>play Doom</li>
<li>eat and imbide Guiness</li>
<li>play video games (it used to be Quake&#8230;?)</li>
<li>Watching/talking/re-enacting Star Wars. [I&#8217;m not that bad! Really!]</li>
<li>Used to be watch sci fi, hang out with friends, go to Jack Astors,   ride your bike, and travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Sigh* The things I used to to &#8230; wait a minute, I still do most of those. At least whenever possible.<br />
17. Do you remember one of the first things I said to you?:<br />
This varied for a few people. The most obvious answer was &#8220;Hi&#8221; or &#8220;Hello&#8221;. (I have a tendency of saying that when I meet people for the first time.) However, a few of you received quite different first words:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;What channel is Animaniacs on?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I wrote this program to enhance this computer game&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>Actually, it was a huge rant about running into Chris on your bike,   and getting invited to said birthday party [I was ranting? Me? Rant?]</li>
<li>no but I remember a math textbook falling on my head [This is from my   high school locker victim, er, partner]</li>
</ul>
<p>18. What&#8217;s my favorite type of music?:<br />
Wow. This one was fun. I knew I was going to get some pretty bizarre answers. For record, everyone was correct on this. It all depends what musical phase you caught me in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beatles</li>
<li>Sting, Sarah [Mclachlan], .. whattya call that?</li>
<li>80&#8217;s pop music [okay, what child of the 80&#8217;s *didn&#8217;t*like that   music?]</li>
<li>Rock</li>
<li>ANY bloody type [Technically, the correct answer]</li>
<li>Sting obviously (that should get me the bonus question eh?)</li>
<li>skit songs from Monty Python</li>
<li>new rock (alternative)</li>
<li>you like everything [again, the technically correct answer]</li>
</ul>
<p>19. What is my best feature?:<br />
If it were possible to blush through email, I would. Many of the answers were quite generous. I should have added a question: &#8220;What is my worst feature?&#8221; I think that would be just as telling.</p>
<ul>
<li>very sweet and generous person</li>
<li>friendly nature and honesty</li>
<li>sense of humour</li>
<li>loyalty, selflessness</li>
<li>Down to earth (wow, that was a surprise!)</li>
<li>Allison.  (Ha, ha, ha.) [This is the same joker who laughed earlier]</li>
<li>friendliness earnestness oops thats two</li>
<li>Smile</li>
</ul>
<p>20. Am I shy or outgoing?<br />
Over the past few years, many people have attempted to tell me what I am. There are those who told me that my hyperness was a cover for my shyness. There are those who told me that I come on too strong. It seems that most people can&#8217;t really decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outgoing especially when chocolate is consumed</li>
<li>both</li>
<li>Outgoing</li>
<li>shy, becoming more outgoing</li>
<li>Outgoing most of the time</li>
<li>you think you&#8217;re outgoing, but you&#8217;re really shy</li>
<li>outgone [I take that means I&#8217;m past going?]</li>
<li>outgoing externally, but internally shy</li>
<li>Definitely outgoing</li>
</ul>
<p>21. Would you say I am funny?:<br />
Generally, this was &#8220;yes&#8221;. The range basically went from &#8220;very&#8221; to &#8220;maybe just a little&#8221; [although I detected an ode of sarcasm on that one].<br />
22. Am I a rebel or do I follow all the rules?<br />
This one was nearly as polarised as #20 &#8212; I obviously put across some very different vibes to people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules, unless you are hanging around Chris.</li>
<li>rebel but in an off the wall way</li>
<li>Well, you don&#8217;t follow ALL the rules, so &#8220;rebel&#8221; it is.</li>
<li>a little of both</li>
<li>Middle of the road</li>
<li>rebel</li>
<li>follow the rules (in general)</li>
<li>you think you&#8217;re a rebel, but you follow the rules, pretty much to a   &#8216;t&#8217; [Ouch! That&#8217;s gonna leave a mark&#8230;]</li>
</ul>
<p>23. Any special talents?:<br />
How do you define a &#8220;special talent&#8221;? I never thought of myself having a talent &#8212; I can&#8217;t act, I can&#8217;t draw (at least without the aid of a computer), I can&#8217;t sing (most of you know that). Okay, I can write (most of you know that) &#8230; but write well? That&#8217;s another issue. The respondants thought I had a few interesting abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;out of box analytical thinking&#8221; is not your average skill&#8230;</li>
<li>excellent writer, great imagination</li>
<li>story telling &#8211; in great detail</li>
<li>many. being a great friend amongst them. Computer knowledge too.</li>
<li>Prolific writing, belching</li>
<li>geez, i dunno &#8211; other than programming?</li>
<li>Playing baseball in flip-flops [when did I do this??]</li>
<li>too many to list. certainly not a couch potato</li>
<li>Never-ending energy</li>
</ul>
<p>24. Would you consider me a friend?:<br />
As a rule, I don&#8217;t make enemies. I don&#8217;t like them. So I generally make (and try my best to keep) friends. It&#8217;s not easy &#8230; particularly when most of them live outside the province. Most replies seem to agree with me on that. A few expressed concerns that perhaps the friendship is waning a little due to the march of time, but I think friendship continues beyond that. If you&#8217;re receiving this email, it&#8217;s because of one of two reasons:<br />
a) You&#8217;re family (or about to be family). b) You&#8217;re a friend.<br />
25. Would you call me preppy, slutty, a homie ,average, sporty, punk, hippie, glam, nerdy, snobby, or something else?:<br />
Wow. Some really crazy answers here. I&#8217;ll let them speak for themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are something else alright. You never remained the same for long   periods of time.</li>
<li>wackey, understanding, talented and more.</li>
<li>smartypants</li>
<li>Hmm, I&#8217;ll choose &#8220;hippie.&#8221;</li>
<li>average [two people thought this]</li>
<li>Edgy (when playing Doom with Scott lurking about the house). [The   Scott in question is from University.]</li>
<li>hippie with a touch of nerdy</li>
<li>dog gone nutty</li>
</ul>
<p>26. Have you ever seen me cry?:<br />
Not many people have seen me cry. Those of you who have probably know me better than anyone else.<br />
27. If there were one good nickname for me, what would it be?<br />
Ah yes, the ubiquitous nickname. I&#8217;ve had a lot of these in the course of my life. I wish I&#8217;d recorded them all &#8212; it would be interesting to see how my nicknames evolved as I got older. At the moment, my nicknames appear to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grapes [my old boss gave me this &#8230; still don&#8217;t know why]</li>
<li>Goff</li>
<li>Ge-off [pronounced &#8220;gee-off&#8221;]</li>
<li>Son of Worf [although I haven&#8217;t really gone by this in a while]</li>
<li>Pepe Gonzales [??]</li>
<li>Han Solo [I feel like a scruffy nerfherder&#8230;]</li>
<li>Propellerhead</li>
<li>Celery [wow &#8212; that&#8217;s one I haven&#8217;t heard since I was a kid!]</li>
<li>Macgyver [Yes, like the TV show &#8212; I got that from my dad, although he   wasn&#8217;t in the survey]</li>
</ul>
