		<p>Today we a good day. Despite the slew of visitors, we finally saw some major improvement in Dad.<br />
For starters, he had a shave &#8212; almost all by himself. And not with an electric &#8212; he used a safety razor. The shave was hardly perfect, but given his condition, it was certainly something to be impressed about.<br />
Then came a big move &#8212; we took Dad for a spin into the living room in a wheelchair. We think Dad&#8217;s finally realizing that he&#8217;s in his own home, and not in a hospital. It&#8217;s definitely a good thing that Mom and Cathy decided to keep him at home.<br />
Last, but certainly not least, Dad stayed up most of the day. This probably will let him return to a more normal sleep pattern. Don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;ll do anything, but it couldn&#8217;t hurt.<br />
The doctor didn&#8217;t come today as expected, so we&#8217;re still in the dark as to what will happen. Unfortunately, this means I&#8217;m still unsure if I should stay, or go back to Calgary. I&#8217;ll hopefully figure that out tomorrow. I do need to go back soon though &#8212; the cigarette smoke is killing me.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>And so ends another day at home. There&#8217;s a strange air of optimism that seems to permeate almost everything. We know what&#8217;s coming, but we&#8217;re always happy and upbeat. Well, Cathy is anyway &#8212; I&#8217;m a little too quiet around Dad. Mom tries to avoid him &#8212; but I think it&#8217;s mostly due to the emotional burden, I think. I certainly can&#8217;t blame her for that.<br />
The key in all of this is distraction &#8212; to find things to do, people to talk to, or events to watch that will take our minds off what is happening down the hall.<br />
For me, it&#8217;s running errands. Usually Mom&#8217;s domain, I&#8217;ve offered to get out of the house and get groceries, sandwiches from Tim Horton&#8217;s, medical supplies &#8212; whatever is needed.<br />
We are lucky (in a sense) that the Winter Olympics are on. For Mom, this is significant. She gives herself to the current event and immerses herself in it.<br />
Especially figure skating. That&#8217;s been Mom&#8217;s favourite sport for almost all of her life, I think. She knows all the moves, she can tell when a skater will make a mistake, and she knows the difference between a lutz and a sal cow (whatever that is). Hughes&#8217; surprise victory tonight was something Mom really needed, I think &#8212; it allowed her an outlet for the emotion she&#8217;s been keeping in for a long time.<br />
Cathy watches her daytime TV &#8212; soaps, Rosie, and Oprah. Around 3:30 or 4:00, Craig drops in and helps entertain. He has the unenviable task of trying to piece the family back together. This is something I cannot do from Calgary. There are times when I wish I never moved away.<br />
Dad just sleeps. Except for a couple of hours today, when Brian Pryce came for a visit, and Aunt Ruth dropped by, Dad slept. Dad had a long chat with Brian &#8212; someting he hadn&#8217;t done for a while. Brian is Dad&#8217;s oldest friend, I can only guess the things they talked about.<br />
My father is still here, although we&#8217;re losing him a little bit more each day. He&#8217;s on morphine, in an effort to keep the pains in his back at bay. But it means he sleeps a lot, and he has trouble answering questions. The key is comfort, not lucidity.<br />
Hopefully, he is comfortable. It&#8217;s hard to tell. Sometimes he&#8217;s grumpy, others he&#8217;s non-commital, and others he looks on the verge of tears. It&#8217;s probably being tired all the time. But he&#8217;s led a good life, and has earned the rest.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I awoke at 4:30 this morning, not originally knowing why I was tired. I had tried (unsuccessfully) to get myself drunk the night before. I wanted to numb the pain. I didn&#8217;t want that dull ache in my gut that told of bad times to come. I didn&#8217;t want to hear that voice that was trying to tell me what I was going to see. But I couldn&#8217;t drink fast enough. I couldn&#8217;t put a stop to the future.<br />
So this morning, I arose, dressed, and caught a cab to the airport. I checked in, made my way to the gate and boarded my plane destined for Toronto. All the while, and through the flight, I tried to simultaneously ignore and accept one simple truth:<br />
I&#8217;ve come home to watch my father die.<br />
This was not a trip I wanted to make. Partly because I&#8217;ve never dealt well with death. I universal constant it may be &#8212; but it&#8217;s one that still leaves me with the cold sweats, one that I sometimes wish didn&#8217;t exist. But I also didn&#8217;t want to come and see a man who was not the father I know and love.<br />
This is one time I&#8217;m glad death does exist. My father is in pain &#8212; perhaps not physical, but the pain of living as he is now probably makes up for it.<br />
This is all due to his worsening medical condition. Last year, my dad beat lung cancer. However, as we were celebrating the victory, some rogue cancer cells were preparing a second offensive in his brain. It led to the condition that brought me here today &#8212; a stroke that hit him early last Friday morning.<br />
Still in Calgary, I had to hear only news and stories from Mom and Cathy &#8212; how Dad couldn&#8217;t recognize people, or how he wanted things that, to us, made no sense.<br />
Today, things are a little better. At first, Mom and Cathy had to take care of Dad on their own. This was a burden they could not fulfill &#8212; it was wearing both of them down. So instead, the hired a nurse to look at his medical condition, a homemaker to change Dad&#8217;s clothes, wash him, and change his diaper (the stroke left Dad without basic bodily controls), and a &#8220;night watchman&#8221; to keep an eye on Dad while they slept.<br />
I walked into my parent&#8217;s home feeling very guilty. I have done nothing. I am almost an outsider here, feeling like I&#8217;m only a spectator in a macabre show. Cathy and Mom have done so much and I so little.<br />
Dad is bedridden. He sleeps in a hospital bed in what was once my bedroom. It is now the room he will likely spend his last days, however many they may be.<br />
Today, he saw many visitors: Ross Gray and Jimmy Johnston, old friends and co-workers from Truck &amp; Tractor &#8212; a company Dad worked for during most of my upbringing. Complete live wires, they had Dad laughing most of the morning, but also wore him down. Rod MacPherson, Cathy&#8217;s and my godfather, was also out. Auth Ruth, who picked me up at the airport, come down to see her brother and keep him in good cheer.<br />
Mrs. Robinson and Julie popped in and out. At one point in the afternoon, she came in to say that she could smell urine &#8212; Dad&#8217;s diaper needed changing. Cathy, Mrs. Robinson, and I took to the task of changing Dad&#8217;s diaper and rolling him on his side (as not to get bedsore).<br />
Most people look at their fathers as strong, powerful individuals &#8212; it&#8217;s a view of my father that I&#8217;ve had for whole life. But in the last year, I&#8217;ve been watching that view slowly develop little cracks. Today, the image was shattered by what seems to be a simple act.<br />
My father is a proud man. Fiercely independent, he had serious trouble when the progression of his illness cost him his driver&#8217;s license. But I&#8217;ve never seen the pain is experiencing &#8212; not until his daughter and his wife&#8217;s best friend, with the loose assistance of his son, changed his diaper.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if he really knew what was going on. But he looked like he wanted to cry. His dignity was gone, and he was now dependent on others. He puts up with it, but I doubt he likes it.<br />
Mind you, I&#8217;m not even sure Dad knows what&#8217;s happening to him. I almost hope he doesn&#8217;t &#8212; knowing that you&#8217;re doing to die is knowledge that I don&#8217;t think most people would want to know. I think Dad&#8217;s having a hard enough time without knowing that.<br />
Hell, I don&#8217;t want to know. I want to reset the clock back 12 years &#8212; back to high school. Things were easier then. The worst thing I had to worry about was my math homework.<br />
I know a lot of people who thing that I must be mad for wanting to go back in time to high school. But most people don&#8217;t seem to look past their own bad experiences &#8212; the cliques, the homework, the bad relationships. I was a simpler time, when families were stronger, and people healthier. While I wish I could dwell in the past, I can only look to the future.<br />
The next few days will be hard. If the doctor is right, we have only until the end of the week.<br />
Life is short, and unfair.<br />
Luckily though, the man in my old bedroom is still my father. He older, he&#8217;s frailer, and with almost no hair, but he knows who he is, who I am, and remembers the good times. I suppose that there is some comfort in that when the time comes, he&#8217;ll have seen me one last time.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m going home, to spend what could be my last few days with my father. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m really looking forward to.<br />
Last Thursday, dad suffered a stroke, probably a result of his brain cancer. It left him paralyzed on his left side, and with a few less marbles in his sack. On Friday, it was dire &#8212; he was near death, it seemed. Today, it&#8217;s not quite as bad, but it&#8217;s not all that good, either.<br />
Dad&#8217;s had a stroke before, one that left him without the use of his left side for a while. But he recovered from that, and had several years without problem. This time, he won&#8217;t be so lucky.<br />
He&#8217;s down for the count, it looks. Unable to understand what&#8217;s happening to him, unaware of people who might be in the room. He seems to be a shadow of the man who took me to the airport two months ago. I&#8217;m afraid that what I&#8217;ll find at home won&#8217;t be the man I know and love. He&#8217;ll only look like him. He won&#8217;t be him.<br />
I dread going home.<br />
But go I must. This isn&#8217;t about me. This is about my family, and keeping it strong through its darkest hour. No-one wants to admit that their parents aren&#8217;t invulnerable, that they won&#8217;t live forever. No-one wants to admit that death is a reality. I know I don&#8217;t.<br />
I can only hope that things will improve. But I think I have assume it&#8217;s a hope I cannot cling to.<br />
[Ed.Note: I did not end up leaving the following day, as planned. I went home on the 20th.]</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It is said that when under pressure (e.g. deadlines), the average geek will let other seemingly less important things (such as personal hygiene) fall by the wayside. Although I can safely say that I still keep myself squeaky clean (either that, or I&#8217;ve got mice under my bed), there was one thing that I didn&#8217;t really keep on top of.<br />
Going to the dentist.<br />
For two years, I let that slide. Unintentionally, I have to add. In fact, I&#8217;m kicking myself for letting it go that long. But with the new year came a number of changes (a new diet, a search for a home, a couple of attempts at regular exercise), one of which was a visit to the dentist. That was a week ago today.<br />
The dentist (Dr. Chin) is quite good. Very sociable, very nice, and extremely professional. His assistants, on the other hand, I think he found at Dominatrices &#8216;R Us.<br />
Because I had no dental records, they had to get those going. Which mean a full set of x-rays of my mouth. Far more detailed than I&#8217;ve ever had before, I should add. I&#8217;ve had the ones you bite down on, but never the ones that come with a fancy bracket and dig into either the roof of your mouth or try to burst out through your lower jaw.<br />
Did I mention I have a really bad gag reflex?<br />
My first dentist (Dr. Wallace) called me &#8220;Captain Choke&#8221;. He hated doing anything but checking and polishing my teeth. X-rays were almost an Olympic event: In goes the x-ray, I start to convulse, he dives behind a lead-shielded wall and punches a button, gets back to me just in time for me to spit it out. (I&#8217;d love to have something like that on film. It would be entertaining to say the least.) It was so bad he wouldn&#8217;t even bother with the fluoride trays.<br />
So while the x-rays were developing, the dental assistant (there must be a universal constant somewhere that all dental assistants must be female and extremely attractive &#8212; mine looks a lot like Claire Forlani) probed my teeth. Much fun. Gingivitis in the top left. (Bad flossing habits, or rather, complete lack thereof.) But otherwise fine.<br />
Well, except for grinding teeth.<br />
None of my other dentists made note of this, so it might be a more recent thing. But it&#8217;s hard to tell. Either way, Dr. Chin highly recommended getting a night guard so I don&#8217;t grind away everything. At the very least, I&#8217;ll find out if I grind my teeth at night.<br />
The x-rays came back, and Dr. Chin started scanning them. He &#8220;hmm&#8221;ed for a few moments, then said something like &#8220;2-7 DO&#8221;. I tried to figure out what he meant. Sounded like &#8220;do over&#8221; to me. Just what I needed, another round of that wretched bracket wedged in my mouth. But I thought I should check.<br />
&#8220;What does &#8216;DO&#8217; mean?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve got a cavity.&#8221;<br />
Twenty nine years, six months, and 14 days. That&#8217;s how long I&#8217;d gone without getting a cavity. But because I&#8217;d neglected my dentist for two years (and drank the my body&#8217;s volume in Coca-Cola in a very stressful December), I&#8217;d managed to finally bore a hole into my previously perfect teeth.<br />
(Okay Cathy, you can stop cheering now.)<br />
I was in shock. Literally. I couldn&#8217;t believe it had happened. I had a cavity. That could mean only one thing. The drill.<br />
But it wouldn&#8217;t be that day. I still had to go through an hour of extensive scraping, gouging, poking, prodding, polishing, and a mess of Kleenex to wipe all the tears of pain away. (What can I say? I&#8217;m a wimp.)<br />
My gums hated me for two days.<br />
Today was my follow-up. I ducked out at 11:00 so I could get to the office (about two blocks from our apartment) by 11:30. I was a little early, which was fine &#8212; they were waiting. With big smiles.<br />
The first thing they did, once getting me down, was stuff a cotton swab in my mouth. I had no idea what this was for. After a moment, I thought it might be a new form of anaesthetic, where I could avoid the needle. Quite content with this, I lay back happily. Then Dr. Chin returned with a needle. A big one.<br />
I hate needles.<br />
The cotton swab was a topical &#8212; so I wouldn&#8217;t feel too much pain as Dr. Chin rammed this device of medieval torture into my upper nerve bundle. Needles are bad enough on their own, but are usually quick. This thing was in there for about a year (actual elapsed time, a couple of minutes), flooding my upper right side with a HUGE dose of painkiller.<br />
Painkillers are funny things. (Especially nitrous oxide. [Insert drum roll here.]) At first you think nothing&#8217;s working. You&#8217;re convinced that you can still feel everything, and this is gonna hurt like crazy. Then you realize that your face has actually slid off your skull and is lying on the floor.<br />
At this point, Dr. Chin thinks it&#8217;s a good idea to get me to sit up so they can do impressions of my teeth for the dental guard. Still being tense from the needle (which actually wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought it would be), all the blood rushed out of my head to hide somewhere. It took all of 30 seconds for me to feel extremely ill. They had to put me back down again.<br />
The next time they brought me up, I was much better. Except that I no longer had control of the right side of my face, from my upper lip to my lower eyelid. Poking it was a peculiar experience because I knew I was hitting something, just couldn&#8217;t figure out what it was. It was like being drunk without all the fun.<br />
Dental impressions are done using some really fun stuff: dental alginate. It&#8217;s basically a funky kind of latex rubber that sets very quickly, and will set in just about anything, including a wet mouth. (Special effects houses use this stuff a lot when making prosthesis for creature effects in movies.) For me, this involved a very large metallic form which gets rammed in your mouth, full of this bitter-tasting pink stuff.<br />
I&#8217;m amazed that I managed to keep the upper mould in for the 45 seconds it took for it to set. I gagged up a storm (and found out why the dental bibs have a plastic backing), but it came out in perfect shape. I prepared for the second one by starting breathing exercises, and staring at a single point on the ceiling. Barely even noticed it was there. The breathing was important, because the worst was yet to come.<br />
At this point, I&#8217;d recommend that anyone who doesn&#8217;t want to read about my tribulations in the chair might want to stop reading. For the rest of you, just don&#8217;t mock me, okay? This is the first time I&#8217;ve had to go through this.<br />
The freezing well in place, the assistant (I think she said her name was Madame Helga, but I&#8217;m not sure) started to insert a &#8220;clamp&#8221; onto a tooth adjacent to the defective one. This clamp looked like something out of the Spanish Inquisition &#8212; big, nasty, pointy, jutty things that gouge into parts of your mouth so that something else can stay in place. (It&#8217;s a little hard to tell, since my eyes can&#8217;t look into my mouth.)<br />
Next came the &#8220;Suffocator&#8221;, a large piece of pink latex rubber (I&#8217;d love to know what&#8217;s with all the pink) which they stuff into your mouth [insert gag reflex here] and connect to the clamp. Then they pack on a 10&#215;10 metal frame that sticks out of your mouth to stretch out the rubber so they can actually see what they&#8217;re doing. I was fine with all of this right until the latex started to stretch.<br />
Eventually, Dr. Chin had to reset the whole thing so I wasn&#8217;t squirming in agony. I think they loosened a tooth in the process&#8230;<br />
With me subdued by the dental dam, they proceeded to relieve me of my precious enamel. At this point, I should mention that the closest I&#8217;ve ever come to a drill was my last dentist, who ran it across some of the deeper crevasses in my rear molars (so I wouldn&#8217;t get anything caught in there). Now I was having a drill actually bore out my teeth.<br />
The problem is that I&#8217;m not a huge fan of pain. Never have been. (I&#8217;d make a lousy spy.) Having my teeth drilled was pretty bad &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was vibration or them drilling through the largest nerve in my body. (It&#8217;s either a lot of pain, or none at all.) Dr. Chin was a little frustrated at me, I think, as I ended up pausing the operation a couple of times because it began to hurt a bit. Turns out it was vibration.<br />
Oh, and talking with that damn dam in your mouth is an exercise in clarity, let me tell you!<br />
Drilling complete, I managed to relax my grip on the chair arms (I think my fingerprints are permanently embedded in the naugahyde) and breathe a little easier. Next came another fun little exercise: Wedging things between Geoff&#8217;s teeth. I have no idea what the heck some of these things where, but none of them seemed to be real dentistry tools. I&#8217;m convinced Dr. Chin was trying to see how many things he could pack into my mouth without me knowing.<br />
The fact that he had to pound a couple of them in there makes me certain of that.<br />
I now had about 15 different tools wedged, clamped, stretched, bored, packed, and stamped into my mouth. (If nothing else, my big mouth actually came in handy for a change.) There was some more poking and prodding, and then finally came out the drill again. But this time, it was to grind off the excess packing they&#8217;d wedged into that teeny little hole. A few moments of that, and then they proceeded to sand.<br />
Yes, sand. With sandpaper. Small strips it, mind you, but it&#8217;s still sandpaper. Back and forth they went, smoothing out where the filling is. (I can&#8217;t even feel it anymore &#8230; but I know exactly where the sanding was. I can feel it on my teeth.)<br />
With that all done, they finally removed all the various implements of pain from my mouth, and released me to the bathroom to tidy up. (I had bits of dental alginate, spit, tooth dust, and who knows what else plastered all around my mouth.<br />
Let loose to the world, I returned to the office and attempted to return to work. It&#8217;s a little hard when you can&#8217;t talk out of one side of your mouth (and every second person cracks a joke about drooling). But luckily, it&#8217;s since worn off, and the only thing that hurts is my tooth.<br />
The one they drilled. Go figure.<br />
This was a small cavity, fortunately for me, but still took about 30 minutes to bore, pack, and file. Why? (Everyone, all together!) &#8216;Cuz I&#8217;m a wimp. If nothing else, it&#8217;s taught me a very valuable lesson: I&#8217;m never going through that again, so I&#8217;m going to have the most rigid dental hygiene from here on.<br />
Speaking of which, I gotta go and brush my teeth.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s nothing like the feeling of soul crushing debt.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s not that bad. Especially when there&#8217;s a darn good reason for it. In my case, it&#8217;s because the last formality of the conditions has been cleared, and the sale is now final. (Yes, I could still technically back out, but it would cost me $10,000, which I&#8217;m not ready to fork out.)<br />
This morning, Chris and I hiked over to what will soon be our new address so I could meet with the home inspector (Don) and go over the results of his findings. This is the first time I&#8217;ve ever met with a home inspector &#8212; or even known a home inspector &#8212; and I have to say that this is one job I&#8217;m not sure that I would want.<br />
Don has to know everything about a house &#8212; what goes into its construction (and that covers all existing homes, new and old), what goes on inside it (heating and cooling systems, water delivery, electrical, etc.), and what could potentially bring it down. This means that there is a huge amount of information that he has to know.<br />
And a lot he had to tell me.<br />
Don&#8217;t think that the house is a lemon &#8212; it isn&#8217;t. Not by a long shot, especially for its age. There were a few things that I need to do, and preferably soon. One is the roof &#8212; apparently some of the shingles are in need of replacement. This is something that will have to wait a year &#8212; I certainly can&#8217;t afford it now. Another is the eavestroughs &#8212; they should be replaced, and the downspouts moved away from the house. (There&#8217;s some slight water damage in the southeast foundation corner that needs patching as a result.)<br />
Beyond that, the rest is functional (or cosmetic) maintenance, and nothing I can&#8217;t take care of regularly. This was what I expected. This is a used home &#8212; people have lived in it before me, so it&#8217;s not going to be perfect. But considering the condition that it&#8217;s in, and it&#8217;s location, I think I got a real bargain on it.<br />
Given, it&#8217;s not huge &#8212; it&#8217;s only two bedrooms &#8212; but it&#8217;s a roof, a sanctuary, and it&#8217;s mine. No more rent (just mortgage payments), no more elevators (just a flight of stairs), no more showers that change temperature every five seconds (just have to make sure to not run out of hot water), no more trying to find a parking spot in the building (but the garage does need a bit of work), no more listening to CP trains or emergency vehicles echoing around (not sure what we&#8217;ll have where we are, if anything) &#8230; it&#8217;s not paradise, but I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.<br />
So this is one less thing I get to babble about now. Considering I was at this for only a month, I&#8217;m almost surprised at how fast this all came together. In fact, I feel so lucky, I should go buy a lottery ticket.<br />
Now you just get to hear about all the stuff that goes along with *owning* a home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The more things change, the more they get strange.<br />
Yesterday, I left the office at noon. This was partly because I&#8217;d been here all night (we were working on a pitch for a client who would be worth a LOT to us) and was caught up in a conspiracy of people forcing me to go home. But added to that, I was meeting with Robyn to go look and some more homes.<br />
There were four on the list, some nearby, and others a little further away. One was in Inglewood (a trendy little area east of downtown), which although nice had a few things that didn&#8217;t sit well with me. The second was in Bridgeland (just north east of downtown). Aside from the fact that it had tenants in the basement suite (and the renovations to make that suite weren&#8217;t all that great, either), I didn&#8217;t think the overall design was great.<br />
House #3 was a considerable improvement. Located just north of downtown in Crescent Heights, it was a beautiful home &#8212; tastefully painted stucco, a nice large front room, great design care inside, and great landscaping. But at nearly $220,000, I had a hard time with the warped floors, tiny kitchen, abysmal basement, and rather unattractive bathroom.<br />
The fourth home was in West Hillhurst, about two or three blocks from Crowchild Trail. On the outside, it was HIDEOUS. Unpainted stucco that really needed some help. My initial impression: This was gonna be a dud. But if there&#8217;s one thing I learned from that house: Don&#8217;t judge a house by its exterior. The owners must do design of some kind for a living. They had it coordinated out the wahzoo &#8212; the entire first floor was completely redesigned in (somewhat recent) IKEA. The only issues with the home were the basement (the stairs down looked unstable and felt twice as bad) and the fact that it sat on a major road.<br />
The afternoon adventure over, I retreated to my apartment to try and get some sleep. No sooner than I had started to drift off than the phone rang.<br />
&#8220;Get your butt downstairs! I&#8217;ve got another place in Sunnyside!&#8221;<br />
Ten minutes later, Robyn and I were back on the road. The house had been on the market for about an hour. (Robyn moves fast.) It was not only the kind of home I was looking for, it was even in the right area of Sunnyside (west end, close to Kensington).<br />
It gets better.<br />
Remember the home that I put the offer in on last Saturday? (See [[Finding a Great House, Losing in a Bidding War]].) Well, this house is it&#8217;s mirrored twin sister neighbour (say that five times fast). Mirroring aside, the only other differences were a double garage and a higher price. The higher price I wasn&#8217;t big on, but it was worth a look.<br />
Well, it would have been, if I could get in to see it. But Robyn always has a trick or two up her sleeve. We put in an offer on the house, with an extra condition: I had to view it and approve. A little strange, perhaps, but such is the nature of the real estate industry. As it stands, the listing realtor was very happy with this &#8212; she would only have to deal with me, and not multiple offers. The viewing was set for noon today.<br />
With a good night&#8217;s sleep behind me, I was prepared for another day of negotiation and kicking the baseboards. Around 10:00 this morning, I got a call from Robyn. I figured she was calling me to make sure I was ready for the viewing. Little did I know what else she had to tell me.<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got good news.&#8221;<br />
I had a mental pause, where I wondered what that news could possibly be.<br />
Remember the house I lost the bid on last Saturday? Well, it seems that the people who had won the bid had put on a rather odd condition on the sale. I don&#8217;t remember what it was off the top of my head, but it was unconventional, very vague (to the point where Robyn said that she would never use the condition), and basically allowed the buyers to back out if they got cold feet.<br />
It seems the people who won the bid need to wear thicker socks.<br />
To avoid the problems of competing offers again, the listing realtor of the &#8220;first house&#8221; (as it came to be known) decided to give me first right of refusal, if I so desired. I desired. So instead of one house to potentially purchase, I now had two.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t stop giggling for most of the morning. Most of the people I told this to just gave me strange looks.<br />
So just before noon, Chris, Robyn, and I ventured over to take a look at the &#8220;second house&#8221;. We couldn&#8217;t get back into the &#8220;first house&#8221; &#8212; I wanted to let Chris have a look &#8212; but luckily I took pictures the last time I was there.<br />
The listing realtor of the &#8220;second house&#8221; was there to meet us, and defend us from the two tenants who lived there (it&#8217;s not owner occupied). It seems the tenants are quite angry that the owner is selling the home, as they&#8217;ve lived there for quite a while and are really attached to it. (My general opinion &#8212; if you like it that much, buy it. If one person (e.g. me) can afford it, two people should be able to.) The realtor wanted to stick around inside, assumedly so I couldn&#8217;t escape without signing onto the deal.<br />
The kitchen was not as nice &#8212; the work was good, but I think it lacked style. The basement seemed even more cramped than its neighbour (but it was also more full of stuff), the upstairs was well finished, although the bathroom was not nearly as nice, and the floor seemed to have a noticeable slope to it.<br />
I was convinced there that this wasn&#8217;t what I wanted. Robyn suggested we go outside and look around back. I&#8217;m not entirely sure this was as a double-check, or just so that she could get me past the listing realtor without signing anything and she could tell that realtor that I wasn&#8217;t going to purchase after all. (By that point, the listing realtor had 12 calls about the house, so it wasn&#8217;t really going to put her in a bind, and the sellers would likely get more for the house in the long run.)<br />
With the purchase withdrawn, we returned to the office to put the offer back in again on the &#8220;first house&#8221; &#8212; the one I wanted. So once again, I scribbled my initials and signature to a series of sheets I&#8217;ve gotten to know quite well. Once again, Robyn made the calls and arranged for a presentation to the sellers. And once again, I had to wait.<br />
This time, it was almost anti-climactic. As I didn&#8217;t have anyone to compete with, I figured I was pretty much a shoe-in. I was &#8212; by 3:00pm, the offer had been accepted. Because I&#8217;d started looking for financing the day before, it was the only thing that still worried me.<br />
I need a fair bit of money to purchase this house. Although I do have a fairly large down-payment (thanks greatly to my extremely generous parents), I still need a large mortgage, and that&#8217;s what I wasn&#8217;t sure about. Luckily, because I spent two years getting all my finances straightened out, my financial situation is pretty good. But I still wasn&#8217;t sure if I could borrow the money.<br />
This little batch of nerve-wracking hell went on until about 7:30pm tonight. That&#8217;s when I got a call from Robyn. She was calling for the purpose of arranging for the home inspection (one of the two conditions, the other being financing, that have to be fulfilled). She asked me how I was doing &#8212; I said I wasn&#8217;t great because the stress of the financing was killing me. I didn&#8217;t want to lose this house a second time.<br />
&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re so silly!&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;You got the financing earlier this evening.&#8221;<br />
I turned around, and saw myself staring back with the same slack-jawed glare of surprise and amazement.<br />
After a loud &#8220;YES&#8221; (which would have had every head on the floor staring at me, if they hadn&#8217;t all already gone home), I finished the conversation. I think I said &#8220;yes&#8221; the entire time to every question she asked. (Hopefully I didn&#8217;t agree to something bad&#8230;)<br />
So, only one condition remains outstanding &#8212; the home inspection. That&#8217;s this Saturday. Once that&#8217;s covered, the restrictions are cleared, and the house is (more or less) officially mine. Then all I have to do is wait &#8212; the closing date is June 1. I&#8217;m just glad I&#8217;m a patient person.<br />
At least I would be, if I didn&#8217;t want everything right now.</p>

		<p>Fewer things are harder than losing a loved one. I suppose it&#8217;s even worse when you lose them slowly. And it&#8217;s only worse when there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it.<br />
My father is dying. As you might recall, late last year, he beat lung cancer. What wasn&#8217;t immediately known was that when he started chemotherapy, the cancer decided it was time to hole up somewhere else. It found a new home in his brain.<br />
Brain cancer is one of the worst. Because it&#8217;s a &#8220;clean zone&#8221;, no chemotherapy will work &#8212; there are biological processes that keep those toxins out. (Though, interestingly enough, they&#8217;ll let cancerous cells in.) The cancer took hold, and started growing. While we were celebrating dad&#8217;s triumph over lung cancer, the unnoticed brain cancer was preparing for the second battle of the war.<br />
It&#8217;s a war that my father is likely to lose. When the tumour was found a month following his radiation treatment (during a follow-up CT scan), it immediately became a problem. It was almost as if the tumour knew that we knew it was there, and was bent on taking revenge for being forced out of the lung.<br />
The first thing to go was dad&#8217;s balance. The tumour was in the right place to throw that off. Steroids solved that problem &#8212; mostly. But it swelled his face quite a lot &#8212; a side effect, so he ended up looking much better off than he actually was.<br />
The last time I saw dad was at Christmas. He wasn&#8217;t the fastest moving, but he was more than capable of carrying out his Christmasy duties. No-one, really, was any wiser to what was yet to come.<br />
Only a few days after returning to Calgary, dad took a fall. Quite a bad one, and injured himself in the knee and ankle. He had to start using a walker &#8212; his lower body strength was atrophying (though his upper body strength seemed no worse). For my father, this was quite a blow, not just physically but also mentally &#8212; he&#8217;d lost his self-support. A prideful man, for him to rely on anything but himself was something I don&#8217;t think he was really ready to accept.<br />
This is common with my family. My grandmother was like this, too. My grandmother used to live in a two-storey Leaside home, until my father and aunt finally convinced her that she needed to move into a retirement home, where she could be looked after and she wouldn&#8217;t have to climb stairs. Although her mobility was fair, she could no longer smell or taste foods. It was a struggle to move her from her home of many decades &#8230; stubborn pride is a tough thing to fight.<br />
Today, I learned that despite another radiation treatment to retard the brain cancer, the disease is progressing &#8220;normally&#8221;. Although we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen, the doctor is hinting that my father will live only until about Christmas.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what I will do without my father. He&#8217;s always been such a wonderful source of information, and a role model that I can only dream of imitating. He tried so hard to be the perfect father, and yet there has always been a slight distance between us. I think it&#8217;s partly due to me &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t the most affectionate child. The rest &#8230; well, it doesn&#8217;t matter, really. He&#8217;s my father, and I love him no matter the past or the future. This is not a year I&#8217;m looking forward to.<br />
Worse, though, is what Cathy will have to go through. Cathy is on the frontlines. She&#8217;s the one who has to deal with dad&#8217;s illness, the one who goes to the doctor, the one who keeps mom and dad going from day to day. I feel so bad because I cannot do the same. As much I would love to take the next six months off, go home and help out my parents, this I cannot do. Perhaps when I do finally find a home of suitable size, I can invite my parents to spend time out here, where I can try to care for them and take some of the load off Cathy, even if only for a while.<br />
This isn&#8217;t exactly the easiest time for all this, either. On a selfish side, I&#8217;ve got a change in my career (more management than implementation), the stress of hunting (and trying to purchase) a house, Cathy&#8217;s wedding (although I&#8217;m not doing a lot with it so far), trying to help out the Rocky Mountain Rail Society (but I&#8217;m swamped at work), and then there&#8217;s my father&#8217;s health mixed in with all of that. It&#8217;s hard.<br />
These are things I want to talk about with my friends. But what do you say? How do I not come across like someone who&#8217;s looking for attention? I just need to talk. My friends know be better than this, of course, so my problem is all with me.<br />
Right now, I can only do what Cathy does &#8212; live day to day. And hope that the doctor&#8217;s prognosis is wrong. He&#8217;s been off before, and maybe &#8212; just maybe &#8212; the stubbornness of the Sowrey family is enough to turn this around.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Early this year (and this month), I finally decided it&#8217;s high time I get myself a permanent address. Not another apartment, but an actual home. Something I can call mine. Something where I have my own walls, my own roof, my own hot water tank, my own hefty problems with municipal sewer service and high property taxes&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s more sobering than jumping in a frozen lake in the dead of winter (but without the sudden shrinkage of certain body parts).<br />
I&#8217;ve been looking for a little while now &#8212; I&#8217;ve been through about 30 homes so far (I&#8217;ve actually lost count &#8212; though I did intend to keep track of every one). I&#8217;m looking primarily close to downtown, currently in about a 5 kilometre radius around Calgary Tower. So far, I&#8217;ve found a number of places that come &#8220;close&#8221; to what I want.<br />
What do I want? Something with more character than the average crap infill or new housing development. The majority of the places have about as much appeal as week-old squirrel road kill &#8212; and generally smell about as nice. I want something much older &#8212; preferably built before 1930 (although I&#8217;ve seen a few built since then that have a certain charm). Why? First, character &#8212; they just ooze it. Second, they&#8217;re quite sturdy &#8212; some goofy building code that was in place until the 20s required homes to withstand massive earthquakes (although we live in one of the most geologically stable regions in North America) and tremendous windstorms. Third, they&#8217;re most likely to have good hardwood floors &#8212; none of this pseudo-wood flooring.<br />
Luckily, Calgary&#8217;s got lots of these homes. So finding one isn&#8217;t too hard. Finding one for sale? Well, that&#8217;s a little more difficult. And finding one for sale in Sunnyside, where I want to be, is darn near impossible. It&#8217;s a 10&#215;8 block area (roughly), and there&#8217;s about two homes for sale at any given time.<br />
Usually for about a day each.<br />
Take the one I just saw today. It was a small home (~950 sq. ft.) about a block from the river. Beautiful little place, built in 1912 and kept in immaculate shape. I liked it so much, I put in an offer to purchase. (You need to do this sort of thing when looking for home I am in the part of the city I like. The basic rule is: You snooze, you lose.) This was at 10:30 this morning, sitting in the Starbucks on Centre Street with my realtor, Robyn.<br />
(A quick aside on Robyn. I met her completely by chance while starting my search for a home while in Oakville at Christmas. I chanced across the home she and her husband are selling, for which she is the realtor. Although her home wasn&#8217;t what I wanted, it was enough to start a relationship. Since then, I&#8217;ve gotten to know this woman very well, and I&#8217;ve gotten to the point with her where we&#8217;re more a team than a client/realtor. Although she&#8217;s still in this for the money, obviously. If any of you are looking for a new home in Calgary, let me know and I&#8217;ll put you in touch with her. I&#8217;d recommend no-one else in this city.)<br />
The house was listed at $209,900. A little high, perhaps, but when you&#8217;re aiming for Sunnyside, this is almost the norm. With the offer contract in hand, she dropped me off at home and told me she&#8217;d call later in the day with news. We expected to have the offer presented around 5pm to the seller.<br />
I should point out at this time that the house has been on the market for one day.<br />
At 2:30pm, I got a call from Robyn. I had a competitor. It was time to up the ante. I&#8217;d put in my offer at $206,000. We bumped it up to $209,900. To further sweeten the deal, Robyn cut $500 from her commission. (See why I like her?) We thought this would be good enough.<br />
I continued at the office until about 4:30pm, when Robyn called again. At first she said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got some good news, and some bad news.&#8221;<br />
There was a pause.<br />
&#8220;Actually, it&#8217;s all bad.&#8221;<br />
I had two more competitors. There were now four of us vying for the same home. It was time to raise the stakes again. $214,000, and Robyn cut $1,000 from her commission. We debated about removing the inspection condition, but I wasn&#8217;t comfortable with not inspecting a 90 year old home. We felt it was solid enough, and put it in. Then the wait began.<br />
At 5:15pm, I got the call. Well, not the call I&#8217;d expected &#8212; Robyn just told me that I had to wait until after 6:00pm before the decision was made. My offer expired at 6:30pm (according to the contract), so I was getting a little anxious. And Robyn didn&#8217;t know what was going on &#8212; she couldn&#8217;t offer me more information than what I already knew. We had to wait.<br />
And wait.<br />
And wait.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t concentrate. This was just annoying. And frustrating, because there was nothing I could do anymore. All I could do was trying to push through the work I had and try not to think about the fact that there was someone negotiating my finances to try and buy me a house, while taking a pay cut herself to do it.<br />
Did I mention I really like Robyn?<br />
Anyway, I got &#8220;the call&#8221; at just after 6:30pm. I could tell by the tone of her voice that we had lost out. Apparently there was still a counter offer going on, but we weren&#8217;t in the running anymore. As it turned out, I came in a &#8220;close second&#8221;, and was &#8220;neck in neck&#8221; with someone else. Neither Robyn or I know what happened yet, but we&#8217;re dying to know how we got beat out.<br />
So the hunt resumes. This is the second house I&#8217;ve put a bid on (I did one earlier this week, but the price couldn&#8217;t come low enough to meet what I could afford), and it won&#8217;t be the last. But it&#8217;s going to be nasty, particularly in Sunnyside. It&#8217;s a cutthroat, dog-eat-dog market right now, and Sunnyside is where everyone wants to be.<br />
I&#8217;m going to rely a lot on Robyn to find me a place. It&#8217;s going to be hard, because I&#8217;m a picky SOB. But I know what I want. The tricky part is getting it, especially with all the competition that&#8217;s out there. It&#8217;s too bad there aren&#8217;t other ways of settling the problems of competition. Personally, I&#8217;ve got a great one:<br />
The first rule of Fight Club is&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is nothing so responsible, so adult, as trying to buy a house.<br />
Okay, there&#8217;s that kid thing, but we&#8217;ll just ignore that for the moment.<br />
I&#8217;ve decided I need a permanent address. For the last 10 years or so, I&#8217;ve been living in apartments of one form or another, and I&#8217;m tired of it. I&#8217;m tired of the rent, of noisy neighbours, of the &#8220;smell of the day&#8221;, of rent that disappears out of my hand and goes nowhere, of the desire to rearrange walls and the frustration not to able to follow through.<br />
Chris is going to Japan, that much is certain. It&#8217;s a matter of when, specifically. Best estimates are July. That&#8217;s another reason why I&#8217;m starting to look. And because I&#8217;m being really picky about where I buy and what I want, there&#8217;s a lot to deal with.<br />
For example: In my ideal world, I get my hands on a two-story home (one level for entertaining, another level for bedrooms, etc.) in Sunnyside (directly north of downtown, across the Bow River). It&#8217;s not in the best of shape (though fine, structurally) and an ideal candidate for renovation. And under $225,000 list. (Combined with shrewd negotiating and a down payment, that would put the price within range.)<br />
So far, no luck. At least within Sunnyside (not many houses are up for sale there at the moment), though there are others in the surrounding area. There&#8217;s lots around the city, but I don&#8217;t want to get too far out of downtown &#8212; no fun in that.<br />
There&#8217;s one house I&#8217;ve seen that&#8217;s been on my mind for a couple of days now. This is what I did on Saturday and part of Sunday (I spent the rest of Sunday visiting with my friend Neall, who was out in Calgary to teach a video game programming course at UofC).<br />
It&#8217;s a 1913 two-story home in Bankview, just southwest of the downtown. It&#8217;s a little on the ugly side at the moment (someone thought that teal was a good colour for a house), and in need of repairs (the front porch in particular, though most, if not all the windows need replacing). On the interior, it&#8217;s currently &#8220;liveable&#8221;. But far from its former glory. It would take about $40-45,000 to get it into good shape, and that&#8217;s a pure guesstimate.<br />
The previous owners have inflicted some pretty poor renovations on the house in years past, including covering all the hardwood floors, half-finishing a kitchen, really bad paint jobs (the moulding looks like there&#8217;s about 12 layers of paint on them) installing a loft for no real reason, and decimating the basement.<br />
That said, I think it would be a huge amount of fun. It would be a long project &#8212; I&#8217;d say at least three years (inside during the winter, outside during the summer), most of which would be saving money for the next round of tearing something apart.<br />
It&#8217;s one of those cases where I&#8217;m actually torn. Part of me doesn&#8217;t want to do it &#8212; the location isn&#8217;t what I want, and I&#8217;m a little afraid at just how bad the house might be. But on the other hand, there&#8217;s a large part of me that things this would be great experience, and a total love affair with restoring a house to good condition again.<br />
I&#8217;ve even had offers of assistance not only from my father, but also from one of my co-workers (Dennis) who used to work for a company that renovated houses. It&#8217;s not like the skills wouldn&#8217;t be available. (And I did spent the first 20 years of my life helping dad fix up the family homestead.)<br />
Well, it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m trying to do overnight. There&#8217;s much to consider before I can make up my mind. But be prepared for the inevitable website chronicling this will slice of life.</p>
