		<p>When the temperature falls to -21 degrees with the wind chill, and the sky dumps 15 centimetres of snow on the ground, that&#8217;s when a young man&#8217;s fancy turns to&#8230;<br />
Revenge.<br />
Some months ago, Chris&#8217; and my collective birthday to be exact, our friend Teak decided that he would give us each a small token of &#8230; well, sugar. Specifically, a lunchbox full of it. When I opened my little gift, candy spilled all over my desk. How he managed to get the candy in there and the lid shut is beyond me&#8230;<br />
Needless to say, when word of Teak&#8217;s birthday came roaming around, Chris and I started thinking. Initially, it wasn&#8217;t anything mean or nasty, but then Chris joked about getting even with Teak for the months of sugar. (I still have some of mine.) It wasn&#8217;t too long before the joke turned serious, and it was time to execute.<br />
Step 1: The plan.<br />
This was perhaps the easiest part. The basic principle was sound: Get one of Teak&#8217;s desk-side cabinets (they&#8217;re a little over two feet tall, about one and a half feet deep, and a foot and a quarter wide &#8212; I don&#8217;t have a ruler, so these are estimates). Empty it. Then refill it. With candy. The trick, of course, was to do it when Teak wasn&#8217;t around (he&#8217;s been in the office late a lot, so working around that was a bit tricky).<br />
Step 2: The supplies.<br />
Sugar. And lots of it. In short, a trip to Costco, about the only place we can get such huge quantities of glucose goodness without completely breaking the bank. There&#8217;s a lot to consider when buying for a stunt such as this. You don&#8217;t want full-sized chocolate bars &#8212; they&#8217;re too big. Halloween ones would have been perfect, but those haven&#8217;t been in the stores for almost a month. You also have to be careful not to get too much of one thing. For example, too many M&amp;Ms, although perfect for something like this, means you need more of them. Also, you want variety.<br />
This meant we had to carefully choose our ammunition. I wish I&#8217;d remembered to bring the list of things we bought, but it&#8217;s along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four boxes of sour gummies (including cherry and watermelon flavours)</li>
<li>Two small tubs of more sour gummies</li>
<li>One tub of marshmallow rats (yes, rats)</li>
<li>One large tub of sugar lollipops</li>
<li>One small tub of Chupa Chups (lollipops)</li>
<li>One box of Blue Whales (gummies that taste like those blue freezies)</li>
<li>A couple packages of marshmallow peaches</li>
<li>Two huge bags of M&amp;Ms (peanut variety)</li>
<li>Two bags of Jelly Belly jelly beans</li>
<li>One container of candy necklaces</li>
<li>One tub of Double Bubble gum (the ones with Bazooka Joe comics)</li>
<li>Three boxes of chocolate and caramel Rice Krispie squares (about the healthiest thing we threw in)</li>
<li>One large bag of Werther&#8217;s (sp?) caramels</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s probably more, but we were having too much fun shopping for this stuff.<br />
Step 3: The prank.<br />
I was in the office again this weekend, partly because I had some work to do, partly because I&#8217;m overhauling my personal website (coming soon to a URL near you), and on Sunday, because I had to know when Teak wasn&#8217;t here anymore.<br />
Around 6:30pm, I took a short trip upstairs. First good news: Teak wasn&#8217;t there. Second good news: Neither was anyone else. Best good news: The poor fool had left his cabinet unlocked. A little after 7:00, Chris called to say he was ready to have fun. I whipped over to the apartment, picked up my roommate and brother in mischief, and returned to the office.<br />
The security guard was puzzled to say the least when we walked in with two huge boxes overflowing with packages of candy. We went upstairs to the Creative Services floor, and found that the lights were still off. (I&#8217;d turned them off when I&#8217;d inspected the floor earlier.)<br />
The first thing we had to do was clean out his cabinet &#8212; the lower part, anyway. Teak had a lot of files, which would of course get in the way when trying to empty the various tubs, boxes, and bags. Fortunately, there are other cabinets which weren&#8217;t in use. A simple transfer, and we were on our way.<br />
Almost &#8230; first, we had to line the lower bin with waxed paper. We didn&#8217;t want to make a total mess.<br />
Then came the fun part &#8212; filling the drawers. Taking several containers, we started pouring. Mind you, this isn&#8217;t some random thing &#8212; you have to do it carefully. You don&#8217;t want to make a parfait of candy &#8212; you want a nice, even dispersion. We had to mix a few times to get the right distribution. But the end effect looks &#8230; nasty, actually, and the smell&#8217;s quite powerful.<br />
Filling the lower drawer, we proceeded to the upper drawer (filling it with mostly small stuff, including M&amp;Ms, and finally the top bin (which sits under the seat), also nice and full. The surprising part was that we&#8217;d had leftovers. We&#8217;d originally thought we didn&#8217;t have enough, and worried that the joke would only be partially realized. But &#8217;tis better to have too much and do the job right than not have enough and do a half-assed job.<br />

The final touch was on Teak&#8217;s computer. Like most of our Designers, he has two monitors (one is usually for seeing the artwork, the second for all the tools). Chris made up two images that were placed on the backgrounds of each of the monitors. One read &#8220;Sugar is sweet.&#8221;, the other &#8220;Revenge is sweeter.&#8221;<br />
I couldn&#8217;t stop giggling the entire time. I so wanted to put up a camera and videotape Teak&#8217;s arrival this morning. I so wish I could have seen the look on his face.<br />
Ah well, all&#8217;s well that ends well. At least until Teak tries to up the ante. If he&#8217;s smart, he won&#8217;t &#8212; starting an arms race with us is &#8230; foolish.<br />
All I can say is: There&#8217;s always room for&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If there&#8217;s one thing Critical Mass knows how to do, it&#8217;s getting its employees horribly, horribly drunk.<br />
Last year, this was courtesy of the Getaway in Westbank (see [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]]). However, owing to financial downturns in the hi-tech sector as a whole (and our industry in particular, following the dot bomb), we&#8217;ve had to scale back. It&#8217;s probably a good thing &#8212; &#8220;The Trip&#8221; would have set the company back $120,000. That&#8217;s two people&#8217;s salaries for the year and the cost of our new Summer Social.<br />
This year, we didn&#8217;t even leave the city. Instead, we went to a place called &#8220;Symon&#8217;s Valley Ranch&#8221;, basically little more than an over-glorified RV park. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; it&#8217;s not *that* bad. Just that it had a lot of people wondering for a while. I think the intention was good, but I wonder if (assuming we have a Social next year) we&#8217;ll go back.<br />
My day started around 1:30pm, when I arrived at the office. (Chris would not attend the Social this year &#8212; a friend was making a short visit to town, and he wanted to spend most of the day with them. I would take the company-sponsored bus to the Social, as Chris needed the car.) Several people were already there. Already the trash talk for the Big Game was starting&#8230;<br />
Trash talk, you ask? That&#8217;s the Soccer game. We have a men&#8217;s soccer team. They&#8217;re good &#8230; not stellar, but they&#8217;ve won better than half their games this year, so they&#8217;re better than average. However, the challenge was put forth &#8212; we&#8217;ve got a lot of very active women here, too. Although not on a team, they claimed they&#8217;d whip the men&#8217;s team in a match. Part of the afternoon&#8217;s events would include a short soccer game.<br />
Although the busses (there were three of them) were to depart at 2:00 sharp, we didn&#8217;t have enough people to fill even one bus. (Our staff, regrettably, have a nasty tendency of being late, or not showing at all.) As it turned out, most drove to the Ranch (located in the northwest quadrant of the city). But those of us who took the bus were the cool ones.<br />
We finally left at about 2:15, one of the busses staying around just in case stragglers finally appeared. As our bus weaved it&#8217;s way through the downtown streets, I heard the clinking of bottles &#8212; one of the Delichte brothers had smuggled beer in his knapsack and was spreading it around. This caught the attention of Di (our company president). The bus didn&#8217;t even make it out of downtown&#8230;<br />
&#8230;before we stopped to make a beer run. Di, Jason, Philippe, and Tamara all raced down the block, returning with a couple flats of beer and a box of coolers. We were finally ready for the trip.<br />
I was admittedly a little disappointed when we arrived at Symon&#8217;s Valley. I had expected at least a couple of trees. But the northwest is much more like prairie scrubland than other parts, so I guess I shouldn&#8217;t have been too surprised.<br />
Symon&#8217;s Valley is (or at least looks to be) primarily an RV park, which sits on the west half of the lot. The east half has a gravel parking lot, a pair of softball fields, and the buildings. The buildings are primarily a ring of ramshackle facades, made to look like an old western ghost town &#8230; or at least look like they were built to look like an old western ghost town. For all I know, they&#8217;re falling apart and no-one&#8217;s fixing them.<br />
The main portion is the mess hall, which can accommodate our large numbers (probably one of the reasons why we went there) and a small bar. The entire motif is western, of course, which means a lot of wood, and a lot of kitsch. But what fun is a faux western ranch without kitsch, anyway?<br />
The bar, of course, was free. That took us about five minutes to figure out. It was unlimited, too. Also a bad thing. We had four days of drinking to make up in a few short hours. (Or at least that was the resounding belief.) We got started as soon as possible.<br />
Around 4:00, the call for the Big Game began to circulate. It was time to find out who got bragging rights for the next year. (And believe me, it would last that long.) The Ranch emptied out onto the softball fields &#8212; the only place big enough for a game. Although there were no goal posts or lines on the field for soccer, a few plastic markers would define the field of battle.<br />
The men were already out, changed into their near-luminescent orange shirts, and limbering up for the game. With Survivor&#8217;s &#8220;Eye of the Tiger&#8221; playing, the women&#8217;s team raced onto the field, ready for battle.<br />
The game was a shortened one &#8212; normally an hour in length, this game ran only 40 minutes. The rules were also bent a little more &#8212; six men versus 14 women. Yes, slightly different odds, but you have to remember that the men had been playing together all season, whereas the women&#8217;s team was thrown together about five minutes before the game started.<br />
It took a while for the women&#8217;s team to get into gear, but with the help of Carmen and Max (who lead the cheers from the sidelines), the women managed to hold the men to a 2-2 game. Bragging rights, such as they were, would be limited to the individuals that day.<br />
Returning to the hall, we proceeded to watch people attempt to ride the mechanical bull. (This was the entertainment for the adults &#8212; the finger painting and popsicle-stick picture frame making had been earlier in the afternoon.) There&#8217;s nothing more fun than watching your co-workers attempt to stay on a hydraulically-driven chunk of fibreglass &#8230; well, actually, there are lots of things more fun, just not at Symon&#8217;s Valley.<br />
Dinner appeared before too long, and we all lined up for grub. It was basically what you&#8217;d expect to see at a picnic &#8212; coleslaw, potato salad, buns, baked potatoes, but we also had roast beef and roast chicken. The beef was a little overdone, but nothing to make it really bad.<br />
Before long, the announcement came &#8212; it was time to board the busses again. Our time at Symon&#8217;s Valley was over and we had to go home. It seemed almost a waste that it was only 8pm.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought that.<br />
As I approached the busses, Eryn informed me that one bus was going to Critical Mass, the other bus was going to Di&#8217;s house. Upon querying the destination of the second bus, I learned that Di had decided to invite a whole mess of people over for a post-picnic get-together.<br />
Most of us boarded the party bus.<br />
Di wasn&#8217;t there when we arrived, but Phil (her husband and one of our copywriters) was onboard, and so let us in. I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure if Phil had been aware of the ensuing party &#8212; but he seemed to be keen about it anyway. We were settled barely 10 minutes when Di, Laura, and Mel pulled up with the beverages.<br />
Flats of beer. 24 cans to a flat. 15 flats in total. (Did I mention that Di&#8217;s our company president?)<br />
My exact words: &#8220;Ooh, it&#8217;s gonna get ugly.&#8221;<br />
The next five hours were a bit of a blur. I don&#8217;t remember entirely everything that happened. But generally, silliness and stupidity abounded. My camera started making the rounds, carried and operated by others, so I still managed to get a record of the ensuing mayhem.<br />
I bailed out around 2:30 in the morning, though I can&#8217;t say with exact certainty. I was drunk. Very drunk. The party continued until the wee hours of the morning, when the cops finally showed up to shut everything down. A true sign of a good party.<br />
Needless to say, following Saturday&#8217;s debauchery, I&#8217;ll not be doing any celebrating any time soon. It takes a lot of energy to do all that, and after a weekend like the one I just had, I&#8217;ll need a little time to recuperate.<br />
Besides, I still have a hangover&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Although it&#8217;s been a very long time since I was a scout, I still try to do good deeds. Last night, nine dedicated CMassers did a good deed.<br />
Owing to employee pressure, Critical Mass started doing charity work some months ago. So far, it&#8217;s entailed a head-shaving fundraiser, an auction, and a couple of food drives (I think &#8212; some of the beginning of this year is a bit blurry). We&#8217;re getting into Habitat for Humanity, though we haven&#8217;t done anything with it yet.<br />
One thing we have done a few times, and this is a regular activity for us, is to make dinner one night at month at the Mustard Seed Street Ministry kitchen, for Calgary&#8217;s financially inhibited. We donate the majority of the food for that meal, and the labour to create it. Last night was my first crack at the kitchen.<br />
We headed over at 4:00 to the &#8220;Seed&#8221; (as it&#8217;s referred to by its staff) to start preparation. We had to chop and cook everything we had with us. Mercy, the Bistro manager and our head chef, headed over early to get started. Within a few minutes of arriving, we were mercilessly chopping celery, broccoli, bok choy (I was &#8220;Bok Choy Boy&#8221;), onions (luckily, they had a machine which did most of the work, but we had to peel and quarter them first), and carrots (I was on peeling detail).<br />
Early into the cutting process, I started to notice a strong stinging sensation in my right hand. I noticed, much to my chagrin, that the knife I was using was literally scraping skin off my forefinger. Most knives are thin metal plates with either plastic or wood wrapped around (or tacked to the side of) the handle. This knife had a serious user interface problem &#8212; the wood was too short, and left an 1/8 inch strip jutting out the top. Although not as sharp as the blade (which was pretty darn sharp, let me tell you), it was enough to peel off some skin. I donned a surgical glove for the remainder of the evening.<br />
Part way through the chopping, I was asked to help out with another task. While four of us cut veggies, three others were chopping fruit. We were making fruit salad for dessert. A lot of fruit salad. About 50 pounds of it, as near as I can tell. It had to be mixed in a very large pot, and I somehow landed the task of stirring the mass of fruit.<br />
With my arm.<br />
I was up to my elbow in melon and strawberries. It was a peculiar sensation, to say the least. It would have probably been a lot more pleasant if the fruit were warmer, but it was still chilled from refrigeration. My fingers were numb after a few minutes. That said, it felt like I was doing a remake of the kitchen scene from &#8220;9 1/2 Weeks&#8221;.<br />
We were making a stupidly large amount of food. The Seed is well-equipped for such a meal, though, complete with a huge array of pots of varying sizes (ranging from gigantic to titanic), scoops that can take about over a litre of contents at once, massive ovens that cooked eight huge pans of rice, an immense grill we used for stir frying the veggies, and a &#8230; uh &#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what to call it &#8230; a square caldron we used for cooking the sweet and sour chicken.<br />
Although I don&#8217;t have a complete recipe, here&#8217;s the one we used to make the sweet and sour chicken:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>80 lb</td>
<td>Cubed, cooked meat (chicken)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15 lb</td>
<td>Onions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15</td>
<td>Garlic cloves, crushed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4&#215;100 oz</td>
<td>Pineapple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 L</td>
<td>Soy sauce</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 cups</td>
<td>Brown sugar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 cups</td>
<td>Vinegar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20 L</td>
<td>Water</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>It all fit into that one cauldron.<br />
Add to that 50 lbs of fruit salad, three very large pots (each about 50 lbs) of vegetables, and at least 40 lbs of rice &#8230; that&#8217;s a lot of food. Aside from the vegetables, it was mostly cooked by 6:30, at which time the staff (including volunteers and ourselves) got to eat. Despite the mass quantities of food, it was still quite tasty. And the rice turned out much better than I thought was possible in an oven (better than any rice I&#8217;ve ever made).<br />
Then the rush started. Heather, Steve, Bill, Therese, and Eryn took the frontline for serving, Carla helped dispense coffee and tea, Mercy cooked the vegetables, and Jen and I did the grunt labour of keeping the serving trays full and the vegetables flowing to the grill to be cooked.<br />
The four and a half hours disappeared, and soon it was 8:30, which is when the kitchen closes. There wasn&#8217;t much left &#8212; a little for lunch, but that was about it. At that point, we were free to leave. All we had to do was cut, cook, and serve. Other staff were responsible for cleaning up after our mess. (And we made a pretty decent one, although it was hard to tell by the end &#8212; the Seed staff are very quick at cleaning up.)<br />
As we began to shut up the kitchen, signifying the end of dinner, one of the Seed&#8217;s patrons stuck his head in through one of the serving windows, to say thanks for dinner. He said something like this:<br />
&#8220;Y&#8217;know the movie &#8216;Angels in the Outfield&#8217;? Well, we got Angels in the kitchen!&#8221;<br />
We had served about 500 people, although we have yet to receive an exact number. We were feeling really good about ourselves. Until we went outside, that is.<br />
There were about a hundred people who hadn&#8217;t been able to get in. A hundred people who wouldn&#8217;t get dinner. It was sobering to realize that for all those you do help, there are always more in need. It just emphasized that what we are doing is in no way trivial.<br />
It&#8217;s also in no way easy. I was sore. I was physically exhausted. And my feet were ready to declare themselves a separate and distinct society from the rest of my body. But it was very rewarding. I opted to skip a movie last night, and instead curled up in a chair at home to rest.<br />
I will help at the Seed again, that much is for certain. Just not until my feet stop pounding.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It was once said that the only thing to fear is fear itself. Fear is the oppressor of souls and nations. It is the beginnings of hatred and suffering. And it&#8217;s what has kept me away from Vancouver. Fear of my past. Fear of opening old wounds.<br />
This is why on Friday past, one year, two months, and four days since I left Vancouver, that I felt it was time to face those fears.<br />
Well, actually, it was a month earlier that I made the decision, but you get my point&#8230;<br />
It basically stemmed from one email I received from my friend Greg, suggesting I come out to see a baseball game in Seattle with some of my former co-workers (and current friends) from Radical. It was part spur-of-the-moment, part &#8220;I really need to get out of this office for a couple days!&#8221;, but when it really came down to it, it was time for me to go back.<br />
I&#8217;d had the opportunity a couple times before, the most recent previous one being an invitation to Katrina&#8217;s &#8220;Glug&#8221; party, a tradition she and Guy have at Christmas. However, I&#8217;d never really felt ready. I had always said I was busy (which was true), but primarily, I knew that mentally and emotionally, I hadn&#8217;t forced off my demons &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t ready to go back.<br />
Rising early on Friday, I made my way to the airport to catch my 7:50am flight to Vancouver. I took public transit, partly for the heck of it, and partly so I&#8217;d get a better idea of times for the next time I do this. Not having the best information available on times and schedules, I ended up with about 20 minutes to wait for the bus once I&#8217;d reached the end of the C-Train line.<br />
I watched the sun rise above the houses, casting long shadows across the bus terminal, and shedding light on a dawn of reawakening. (It&#8217;s amazing the stuff you can dish out when you&#8217;re being philosophical, eh?) It was my first real thoughts about what I was about to do. Would I run into my past, and would she confront me? Would I see any of her friends? And more importantly, what would I do? These were questions I was unable to answer, even though I&#8217;ve been thinking about that very thing for over a year.<br />
Soon I found myself at the airport, awaiting the boarding for the flight. Unlike my previous flights with Air Canada (see [[Christmas in Oakville, New Years Eve in Calgary]]), this flight left right on time. The flight was uneventful &#8212; up, breakfast, read, down. All told, about an hour and 10 minutes.<br />
Descending into Vancouver was &#8230; weird. I recognized everything. Surrey, Coquitlam, Burnaby, New Westminster, the Port Mann Bridge, Metrotown, the Richmond Auto Mall, IKEA. It almost felt like I&#8217;d never left, but at the same time, there was a strange feeling. Something between excitement and knowing you&#8217;re being watched.<br />
BC Transit being on strike, I had to take a taxi to get out of the airport. (Although Greg had offered to pick me up, I had told him not to waste his time &#8212; I knew he already had a killer schedule, and going to the airport is quite a bit out of his way.) The trip was quite, pleasant, and a brisk drive down memory lane. In less than 20 minutes, I was standing on the corner of 10th and Granville, wondering what I was going to do next.<br />
The first thing I did was call Lee, who had been Radical&#8217;s Director of QA and the coach of the Rad Sox. Being already at work, we agreed to meet that night, as planned, at Soho&#8217;s in Yaletown. I so proceeded to step #2 &#8212; wait. I wanted to hold off until about 9:30 before calling Katrina (another friend and former co-worker), but I didn&#8217;t want to disturb her too early in the morning. (More on this in a few paragraphs.)<br />
So it was off to one of a thousand local Starbuck&#8217;s to indulge in my second hot chocolate of the morning (the first being at the Blenz in Calgary airport). I sat, sipping my venti, and really thought about where I was. I actually sat with my back to the door, a little worried about who might walk through it.<br />
Irrational fears are the worst kind.<br />
After pondering the state of affairs for about a half hour (ventis are pretty big), I retreated to the moist Vancouver air, and proceeded to contact Katrina. I had hoped to meet up with her that morning, as I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what I was going to do that day. I had originally hoped to meet up with Lee for coffee, and then visit with Katrina later that morning. However, things don&#8217;t always go according to plan &#8212; Katrina was busy getting all the things she and her husband needed to pack everything in their home so they could move to San Francisco.<br />
I sat next to Katrina for two years. She&#8217;s one of the people I miss most about Vancouver, along with several of my co-workers. They were what made my life there happier than it would have been. But now Katrina was also an ex-Radicalite, and moving on with her life by accepting a position at Pixar. Yes, the same people who brought you the &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; movies and &#8220;A Bug&#8217;s Life&#8221;. Not only am I impressed, but I can actually say I know someone at Pixar. This was too cool.<br />
Resigning myself to having a morning on my own, I proceeded to run errands. First was a quick stop to the bank to deposit a rebate cheque (I had to deposit it in person, and getting to the bank during the day ain&#8217;t easy). I then stopped quickly at Bernard Callebaut to pick up some chocolates as a kind of &#8220;bon voyage&#8221; present for Katrina and Guy.<br />
Then I wandered. I wander well, particularly when I have nothing else to do, and I know (more or less) where I&#8217;m going.<br />
I headed towards downtown along Granville. I decided I wanted to go to Burrard Inlet and look around. It wasn&#8217;t a great day &#8212; the sky was overcast and I was being spit on periodically from above &#8212; but it was good day for looking around. But being in a wandering mood, I made a side trip through Granville Island, one of my favourite places in the city.<br />
On my way in, I stopped to donate some spare change to Jack &#8220;The Bear&#8221;, a self-employed social worker who strives to make his &#8220;group&#8221; (whomever they are) better off. I&#8217;d seen and heard of this guy before, and not being in a rush, I allowed myself (somewhat unwittingly) to end up in a half-hour pseudo-speech. He&#8217;s an articulate man, and he certainly has some interesting ideas. I tried to offer a few suggestions (his ideas, though good, need the odd improvement), but getting a word in edgewise is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s easier sliding papers between the blocks of the Western Wall in Jerusalem.<br />
I wandered about the Island a bit, and went into the market. They say that smell is one of the most powerful memory triggers. The second I walked in the door, it felt like someone was force feeding me 1,000 TV channels at once as snippets of two years suddenly raced through my mind. Some good, some bad &#8230; but after a moment, all I could smell was the produce, and food is always good. It took a lot of will power to get out of the market without buying anything.<br />
I exited the Island via the Aquabus, which ferried me to the other side of False Creek. This was far better than walking all the way back to the foot of the Granville Street Bridge, and then walking all the way back downtown again. I hadn&#8217;t really noticed how much I missed the smell of the sea, not until I got near the water. The smell is unmistakable, and wonderful. I think I was a fish in a previous life&#8230;<br />
The wandering continued as I worked my way down Granville. Not much had changed &#8212; same stores, same buildings, even some of the same people. The city line had a few new condos, and there was the odd old building reduced to a parking lot, but otherwise it was the same. Tagging (a form of graffiti) was very prevalent, especially at the Paradise and Caprice theatres (both now closed). Not unsurprising, I hate to say. The Eaton&#8217;s was open again. A new pub sat kiddie-corner, which had been abandoned or under construction during the entire time I was in Vancouver. A new London Drugs is open at the corner of Granville and Georgia. It used to be book store, which went under when Chapters moved into town. The London Drugs had moved from its old store further down the road, now open to anyone silly enough to lease the space.<br />
Canada Place was seeing some new construction. I had vaguely remembered a plan to expand the pier to increase convention space. The plan, it seemed, was thoroughly under way. As such, my favourite vantage point to view Burrard Inlet was unavailable. Instead, I took up a viewpoint on the promenade between Waterfront Station and the Province&#8217;s building.<br />
Although the view was essentially the same as the last time I&#8217;d viewed it, something seemed different. Not as much life &#8212; it seemed almost a little dead. I don&#8217;t know if it was a changed perspective due to my departure a year earlier, or if it was the weather. It almost looked like someone had dropped out some of the colour from the image I was seeing.<br />
I was still a little afraid, I think.<br />
Through Waterfront Station, and onto Water Street, I walked through Gastown. Not much had changed there, either. A couple stores had moved, a couple closed, and one lot (or building, I&#8217;m not sure which) had been opened up. I think there had been a restaurant there once, but I can&#8217;t really remember. The same burned out husk of a building sat across the street from the Olde Spaghetti Factory, though the structure supports had been beefed up a lot. I shook my head, wondering what on earth was going on there.<br />
I turned up Carrall Street, and headed back towards False Creek, Science World glinting in the distance. In moments, I realized that I&#8217;d made a bit of a blunder. This is what I get for pondering and not paying attention. I found myself at the corner of Carrall and W. Hastings. It&#8217;s known as Pigeon Park, and has the highest murder rate of any location in Canada. It&#8217;s not pleasant during the day &#8230; but you don&#8217;t go near it at night. I briskly walked through and on across the road. I didn&#8217;t feel safer until a couple of blocks later.<br />
I stalled a bit longer (I wasn&#8217;t due at Radical until almost 1pm) and made a side trip through the International Village, a large mall, still mostly empty over a year and a half since it opened. It looks really nice, but I wonder how much money they must lose from the lack of tenants.<br />
Up Abbott, I arrived at Pacific. This took me over towards Quebec Street, and onto Terminal Avenue. I was in the home stretch. Aside from Greg, I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone from Radical in over a year. Fear was rapidly being overcome by nervous combination of excitement and panic.<br />
My first run-in was with Fernando and one of the Foundation developers, whose name I couldn&#8217;t remember, even though he started at Radical the same day I did (my panic began to rise as I realized I couldn&#8217;t remember names). A few moments later, I entered the foyer of Radical&#8217;s new home, and headed right to the top floor.<br />
The receptionist I didn&#8217;t recognize. Lisa was gone, so I find out, having quit back in the summer. Greg could not be found, nor could Joel. Luckily, we could find Neall. As I waited for him to arrive, I heard my name being called by Allison. She had also started the same day as me, but unlike myself, was quite comfortable at her job. She looked good as ever, and still bore the same wonderful smile she always seemed to have.<br />
Neall hadn&#8217;t changed much, either &#8212; though I was just as happy to see him again. The reunions started to come quickly as Dave appeared through the main door, and Fred from the back office. Names were flitting around in my head so fast, I knew I was going to be in trouble. I nearly forgot Fred&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Neall offered to take me on a quick tour, and show me what Radical had moved in to. Having used up all their old space, Radical had taken a lease in a near-brand new building, and had the interior made up to their specifications. It&#8217;s quite nice, really &#8230; especially the log cabin in the common room.<br />
Yes, a log cabin. It&#8217;s their home theatre. I&#8217;ve seen and heard of some pretty wacky things in companies, but this is one of the wackiest. The common room at Radical is two stories tall, and easily big enough to fit a small house. It also has a 270+ degree view of Vancouver, including what must be a magnificent view of the North Shore.<br />
A new building, but it wasn&#8217;t much different than the old building &#8212; totally organic space, managers in the middle, work teams scattered around the outside. Greg had commented that Critical Mass&#8217; building looks more polished, but for the environment, I know a lot of people here would prefer Radical&#8217;s setup.<br />
Eric was still in a dungeon. This is where he likes to be &#8212; in the dark, away from everyone. I assume it lets him get on with his work. Martin was with him, discussing physics calculations. Mark was in the office he shared with Neall, looking none the worse for wear. Across from the office was Jean-Luc and Senta (whose name I sadly forgot, and I felt like such a heel for forgetting it), and a desk away was Nigel. He summed up my return rather succinctly: &#8220;The more things change, the more they stay the same.&#8221;<br />
Down the floor, I ran into Lisa (the office manager) and Cliff (one of the IT guys). I inadvertently interrupted their conversation, but they didn&#8217;t seem to mind too much. Neall took me down a floor to show me around a bit more. There were a lot of familiar faces, but many of them without names. I was now feeling particularly bad about forgetting so many people. It wasn&#8217;t until later that I remembered Yayoi&#8217;s and Rod&#8217;s names, something I&#8217;m not horribly proud of. Jesse seemed a bit surprised to see me, but then I don&#8217;t think he knew I was coming out.<br />
Returning to the seventh floor, I finally found Greg. He immediately started to apologize for not being around. Greg was up to his neck in E3 preparations. The game he&#8217;s working on has to be down there for exhibition, and there were still a lot of issues to clear up. Although it had been planned a month in advance, I hadn&#8217;t picked the best weekend to come out.<br />
Just before lunch, I finally ran into Tim, my old boss. He&#8217;s now one of the VPs (Neall is now the head of Pure3D), although I don&#8217;t know of what specifically. He had always been a fairly serious person while I was there, but he seemed somehow happier. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the haircut, but he looked better off.<br />
Members of Pure3D (Neall, Mark, Nigel) and Pure3D alumni (Kevin, Greg, Gabe, and myself) all went out for lunch, to a place called The Whip. (Gabe picked us up; like me, Gabe is also an ex-Radicalite.) It seemed somehow wrong that we weren&#8217;t eating anything Asian. Pure3D ritual had been typically Chinese. This was definitely not Chinese &#8230; although it was very tasty. The conversation, though, was definitely Pure3D.<br />
The more things change&#8230;<br />
After lunch, I finally met up with Joel. He&#8217;d been a bit of a harder character to find, being the lead programmer for one of Radical&#8217;s projects (meetings being the bane of his existence). He looked tired, like everyone else on the team. Being sick probably didn&#8217;t help much, either. We talked for a while, but I chose to keep the conversation fairly short, as he was busy dealing with the crises of getting a game ready for E3.<br />
I took the opportunity to leave Radical and go visit with Katrina and Guy. By now, it was raining outside, so I was quite happy to find the Aquabus still running between Science World and Stamp&#8217;s Landing, where Katrina and Guy live. They were home, and it only took a few moments (with a bit of direction) to get down to their slip.<br />
Oh, did I mention they live on a sailboat?<br />
This was why it was so difficult for them to get ready to move. Not only do they have to pack their belongings, they have to move their house as well. Logically, not an easy move. But they seemed fairly calm about it &#8212; most people get downright cranky when they move.<br />
I spent most of the afternoon with them, talking for a while, but them helping them pack. It was partly because I wanted to get the skinny on their move. It had come out of nowhere (at least from my perspective), and I was very curious to get their thoughts on it. They were excited. New place, new challenges, and it sounded like a lot of fun. Not wanting to get in their way of packing, I&#8217;d also offered to help them pack. Katrina and I spent the afternoon wrapping things in bubble wrap.<br />
I probably stayed longer than I really should have, but I felt compelled to not just drop in for a few minutes and then bolt. After all, I&#8217;d spent two years sitting next to Katrina, working with her, talking with her, and learning from her. Besides, until I go to San Francisco, I don&#8217;t know when (or even if) I&#8217;ll ever see her again.<br />
At 7:00, all three of us had to leave. Katrina and Guy were going to a friend&#8217;s place, and I was due to go to SoHo&#8217;s and meet up with Lee (and hopefully, people whose names I could remember). Despite being nearly 40 minutes late by the time I got there, I was the first to show. (Hopefully, we didn&#8217;t scare off any other potential revellers.) The second person to arrive was Ryan, a Radicalite whom I wasn&#8217;t sure was there to come out with us, or was meeting other friends. Luckily, he remembered me, and reintroduced himself. I was glad, because even when I was at Radical, I really didn&#8217;t know who he was&#8230;<br />
We talked at length until Lee arrived. You&#8217;d swear no time had passed since the last time I&#8217;d seen her. She didn&#8217;t look a day older, and was just as upfront as ever, just the way we love her. It didn&#8217;t take long for any awkwardness to pass. Soon, we were embroiled in animated conversation, along with one of Lee&#8217;s co-workers, who had also come out. Not too many Radicalites (ex or otherwise) came out that night, although I was very happy to see Lisa (the ex-receptionist) again. I&#8217;d always thought I&#8217;d gotten along with her very well, and had missed saying &#8220;hi&#8221; to her every morning.<br />
Somewhere in the evening, I stopped looking over my shoulder. I stopped looking in the shadows. I stopped being apprehensive. It was like I suddenly knew the story, like I&#8217;d already seen the movie and knew exactly when the creepy, half-dead monster leaps out. It was like the fear had dissipated like morning fog. Sure, the past will always be there, but spending the day in Vancouver, and with my friends, had shown me there was nothing to fear. It was only then that I truly felt relaxed.<br />
Neall appeared around 10:30, and joined our little group. Greg made a brief appearance, only to apologize for not coming out. The debate of where I would stay that night (begun earlier in the day) apparently had been solved &#8212; Neall would drop me off at Mark&#8217;s on our way home in preparation for the next day. This left Greg to quickly go to a friend&#8217;s birthday party, catch a few hours sleep, and get back to work early the next day. Sadly, because of the deadline, Greg wasn&#8217;t coming with us.<br />
Neall and I finally managed to leave SoHo&#8217;s around 12:30. I gave Lee a big hug (we&#8217;d had a good, deep conversation for most of the night, and I remembered all over again why I missed being around people like her), and stepped out into the cool night. Neall and I walked back to Radical, enjoying the walk, and talking about the state of Radical. It was refreshing to see how things had evolved since I&#8217;d left. It was very reassuring to see that management (including Neall, now that&#8217;s he&#8217;s part of the &#8220;establishment&#8221;) still has a firm grip and good steer of the Good Ship Radical.<br />
Fires were raging when we got into the office. A Pure3D patch hadn&#8217;t taken well, and Neall had to help out Vlad (the technical director) to get the software working again. Also, we were giving Eric a lift, and he was still working out a few issues with a demo he was programming. (He&#8217;d been at it since late Wednesday, I believe &#8230; non-stop. He hadn&#8217;t gone home.) Due to these reasons, we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 2:30. This also meant I was now staying at Neall&#8217;s, because it was now too late to go to Mark&#8217;s.<br />
I crashed on Neall&#8217;s couch that night. I was exhausted. I&#8217;d been up for just about 23 hours straight since that morning, walked about 10 kilometres since that morning, ate almost nothing outside of a sandwich at lunch, and was ready to fall dead. I was asleep in seconds.<br />
The alarm came far too early for my liking. But we had to get rolling fast &#8212; we had a baseball game to go to. Although the game didn&#8217;t start until 1:05pm, we had to pick up Neall&#8217;s sister, drive to Mark&#8217;s, pick up Gabe, and then drive to Seattle. It&#8217;s not a long drive, but it still takes time. Although we moved as fast as possible, we were delayed by a mysterious case of nose bleed, which I have yet to explain. (It plagued me the entire weekend.)<br />
After a slight detour to pick up Angie (Neall&#8217;s sister), we arrived at Mark and Carol&#8217;s to switch to a different vehicle. Our trip to Seattle would be in style &#8212; a Warner Brothers edition Chevy Venture. Nothing like being able to play video games and watch movies during the trip. Then it was off through to the west end of Richmond to pick up Gabe. It was almost 10am by the time we were all on our way to the border.<br />
We arrived in Seattle around noon. Mark deftly whizzed us through the various onramps and city streets towards the Port of Seattle, where Safeco Field lies. (It&#8217;s adjacent to the site of the former Kingdome, now the site of the new football stadium.) You can&#8217;t miss Safeco Field &#8212; it&#8217;s big. And it&#8217;s colour is unique for the area it sits in. There I found that Carol wasn&#8217;t joining the game with us &#8212; she was going shopping while we enjoyed America&#8217;s pastime. Unfortunately, that also meant she took the van with her, which contained my jacket. (Upon hopping out, Gabe and I declared that it was warm enough to go without jackets &#8212; Angie and Mark were far wiser, and Neall had a heavy shirt.)<br />
Safeco Field, although new and (assumedly) state-of-the-art, was built in the tradition of the great baseball fields: Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, and Wrigley Field, and Comiskey Park. It&#8217;s also a dedicated baseball stadium &#8212; no other sports (or events, as near as I can tell) occupy the space. The field is grass, and the stands are open to the wind &#8212; only the roof rolls shut to block out the rain (important on the West Coast).<br />
Our seats were at first base, about 20 rows up. Aside from the overhang of the upper deck which blocked the view of some of the flies, they were great seats. We were also one row away from the promenade, where we could find virtually any snack food imaginable, including the ubiquitous hot dogs, but also garlic fries, fish and chips, clam chowder, hamburgers, pizza &#8230; and all by local companies, no McDonald&#8217;s or Versa Foods here.<br />
This was Game 2 in a series between the Mariners and the Blue Jays. The last time I&#8217;d seen a Blue Jays game was about 10 years ago in Skydome, though it might have been 11 &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen so many, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. Almost all of my Jays games had been courtesy of a family friend, Mr. Gairdner, who offered us his season tickets from time to time. I had forgotten in those years just how much fun professional baseball really is.<br />
Well, when you&#8217;re not freezing to death.<br />
I made one major mistake. I left my jacket in the car. I should have been smart and brought it with me. But no, I thought I was fine. Stupid me. I forgot that I was on the West Coast, where the humidity is much higher. I&#8217;m beginning to realize that until the temperature rises into the low 20s (Celsius, of course), it will always be cold for me in the more humid regions of the world. Living in Calgary has dried me out, and my immunity to the cold seems to have waned. I can hack -20 degree weather here quite easily. But minus six in Toronto was brutal at Christmas (I wasn&#8217;t even phased by -20 when I used to live in Ontario), and I was finding that even 13 degrees in Seattle was cold, especially with the wind. I chose to put up with the chilliness, rather than fork out the money for a Mariner&#8217;s jacket&#8230;<br />
The opening ceremonies were a different spin on what I remember from Toronto. Like the Hitmen games I&#8217;d seen last month, Major League Baseball now has games to entertain viewers &#8212; kids&#8217; home run derbies, and pitching contests. Personally, I think it cheapens the game, reducing the game to almost something of a sideshow.<br />
What impressed me was the singing of the national anthems. They brought in the Walla Walla High School Chamber Group. Although American, they sung perhaps the most amazing rendition of &#8220;O Canada&#8221; I&#8217;ve ever heard. It actually brought a tear to my eye. Mark was the only one of us who sang along &#8230; I usually don&#8217;t because my singing usually sends people running for dear life. The choir&#8217;s rendition of &#8220;Star Spangled Banner&#8221; was, sadly, typically American &#8212; seldom sung the way it was written. There are times I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m Canadian, where our national anthem is sung only two ways, English and French, and is always the same length.<br />
I&#8217;m not entire sure how many Canadians were there that day (we saw a few Canadian flags floating around), but there was a fair bit of cheering when Toronto took the field. Understandably, though, the cheering was much louder when Seattle came out &#8230; especially for their right fielder, Ichiro Suzuki. He&#8217;s one of two Japanese players with Seattle, and both are immensely popular, the other being closing pitcher Kazuhiro Sasaki. They&#8217;re good players &#8212; Ichiro hits a mean ball, and Kazuhiro throws a pretty vicious pitch.<br />
The game was tight &#8212; a couple home runs, some really great fielding, good solid hits, and the odd error made for some really good drama. I remembered watching the World Series back in 1992 in the townhouse I shared with roommates Roger, Ed, and Brian, screaming at the mistakes and groaning every hit the Braves made during the sixth game of the World Series, only to later wake the dead (along with everyone else in the complex) as the Jays went onto victory.<br />
Different team, different city, different opponents, and not even a championship on the line &#8230; the emotions were all the same. We all huffed at missed chances, cheered for the really good plays, and whined when the Mariners scored. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t a blow-out for either team &#8212; a good solid race clear through. The only way I would&#8217;ve enjoyed it more was if I&#8217;d been warmer.<br />
By the seventh inning, I was chilled to the bone. Neall noticed my sad plight, and literally gave me the shirt off his back. I knew the four of them were laughing me &#8212; admittedly, I was laughing at myself. Once upon a time, the cold didn&#8217;t bother me. I hate to admit it, but I&#8217;m a damp weather wimp now.<br />
The game ended on a down note &#8212; the Jays lost 7-5. After watching the roof close (which is a bit of spectacle in itself), we worked our way out and tried to meet up with Carol. The only problem was navigating through the 42,000 other fans who were doing roughly the same thing. Fortunately for us, Carol and I were both equipped with cell phones, so after a few conversations, we managed to all meet up.<br />
Departing the port, we headed into the downtown area, to Pioneer Square, and the Elliott Bay Book Store. This is perhaps the coolest book store I&#8217;ve ever been in. It&#8217;s huge &#8212; about the size of a chapters, only with more books. And it&#8217;s in (what I would assume to be) a heritage building. Being from Alberta, buying books in the States doesn&#8217;t really save me any money, so I just took the time to look around.<br />
Hunger soon had it&#8217;s call, though, and we were off in search of food. Unfortunately, no-one was particularly helpful in deciding where to go. We drove somewhat aimlessly around Seattle trying to find a place to eat, all the while asking &#8220;where are we going?&#8221;. We ultimately ended up at 13 Coins, a restaurant Mark had learned about in a travel guide.<br />
One day, I will finally obtain proof that the restaurants that appear in travel guides are only there because the restaurateurs bribed the author. Of all the so-called great places to eat that I&#8217;ve read about, only a couple were actually good. Unfortunately, 13 Coins wasn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
This place had decor that even Elvis would be terrified of. I was convinced that someone had loved the 70s so much, that they refused to redecorate with anything less awful. But when you take into account the &#8220;cheese factor&#8221; of such a place, it&#8217;s kind of interesting &#8230; for a novelty, that is.<br />
The quality of the food, so I&#8217;ve found, usually matches the decor. And believe me, it was pretty darn hard to find something on the menu that I wanted to eat. (Mind you, it was mostly because I was still full from the hot dog, chicken strips and fries, and the tepidly bland hot chocolate I&#8217;d had at Safeco Field.) I settled on a Philadelphia Steak Sandwich, which turned out to be a small piece of beef on garlic toast. Not great, but I&#8217;ve had worse.<br />
The trip back to Vancouver was marked with the showing of &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;. (Note to self: Make sure there is a video system in my next car.) Despite it being one of my favourite movies, I still fell asleep for about an hour or so. The movie ended just as we were pulling into Richmond, and dropped off Gabe. The next stop was at Radical, where I was going to meet up with Greg. I grabbed all my things (I&#8217;d brought my bag with me), and said goodbye. I called up to Greg, who came down to let me in. A quick thumbs-up sent Mark, Carol, Neall, and Angie off into the night.<br />
Greg, along with several of his team members, were hard at work on their game. It was going to be a late night, which Greg immediately started apologizing for. But frankly, I didn&#8217;t mind hanging out at Radical. I always liked hanging out there, even when I was the only one. It was a fun company, and near as I can tell, still is. Greg and I struck a happy medium &#8212; while he coded, I would test.<br />
So for the next four hours, I played a game that no-one will see for about four months. And no, I can&#8217;t tell you anything about it. I will say this &#8212; it&#8217;s a LOT of fun. Greg, like most of the programmers I worked with at Radical, are wizards &#8212; they can churn out some of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever seen or played. This game was no different. Although it won&#8217;t set any new standards for graphics, the game play is outstanding &#8230; definitely better than another game that will ultimately be compared so when it finally ships.<br />
The game doesn&#8217;t wrap up until early August. So why the crunch in early May? The Electronic Entertainment Exposition, known as E3, which is in mid-May. This is when all the Christmas games first appear. This is when game companies try to outdo each other. This is *the* event if you work in the video game industry. And this game is debuting there. Like any good video game project, they were under the gun to tweak enough stuff to make it play really well, and make a lot of people very jealous.<br />
Personally, I think they nailed it perfectly.<br />
Somewhere around 2am, Greg and I headed out for his place in very east Burnaby. We stayed up for a short while and talked, but we were both so tired, we opted for sleep instead.<br />
Sunday morning came around 9:30. I was still exhausted from the day before, but rose and showered and prepared for the day. Not there was much to prepare for &#8212; there wasn&#8217;t much on the agenda. A quick breakfast at IHOP, and we went back into the office. We weren&#8217;t there too long, as I had to go to the airport. This time, Greg drove me out, which I was thankful for (the transit strike makes getting a taxi outside of the airport rather difficult). I bid him farewell, he drove back to work, and I checked in for the flight.<br />
I slept on the way back, though not intentionally. I was utterly wiped. I hadn&#8217;t been so active in so long that my body simply wasn&#8217;t ready for it. I vaguely remember something about 35,000 feet, and something about returning my seat to its original upright position. Next thing I knew, I was hopping the bus home. And as we all know, home is where the heart, bed, and 50&#8243; TV are. This was where I was determined to spend the next several hours &#8230; sleeping.<br />
Unfortunately, it seemed that my vacation would be cut short. Crisis at Critical Mass &#8212; the site I was working on had basically fallen apart in my absence. Somehow, I&#8217;d become the centre of communications, and without me around, everything came to a halt. I didn&#8217;t get home until 1:30am.<br />
I look back at my weekend, and I actually have to force myself to believe I was actually there. With all the apprehension I had towards going back, I now find it hard to believe I did it. But I know I did, and I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad I saw my friends again (despite the fact that I feel like a twit for forgetting names). I&#8217;m glad I saw a Blue Jays game (even though they lost). But most of all, I&#8217;m glad that my past is now just that &#8212; behind me. All that&#8217;s left is the possibility of the future.<br />
Vancouver is a destination for me. Not to live, but certainly to visit. I will see sights I never saw, I will do things I never got the chance to do. I&#8217;m content that no matter what I see and do, it was because of me (with a lot of support from my family and friends) that I&#8217;m capable of doing it. And so long as I know people in Vancouver, or at least have an inkling of a reason, I will go there, and I will enjoy myself each and every minute.<br />
At least when it isn&#8217;t raining.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Life is abdunant with difficult experiences. Some come from education, some from your job, some from a close relationship with a potential life partner. But there are few experiences that are as hard as saying goodbye to good friends.<br />
Critical Mass is opening an office in Toronto. Its first day of business is Monday the 19th. We&#8217;re staffing it with some people who were hired and brought here, and with some who were here and want to go back east. Tonight, Critical Mass said a fond farewell to 23 of its own, as they prepare to embark on a journey to the centre of the Universe (otherwise known as Toronto) and open our new office.<br />
It could have been more emotional, I suppose, but that&#8217;s probably why there was free alcohol, to keep us placated. (In retrospect, not a bad thing.) But it still didn&#8217;t dull the pain of seeing people leave. I know most of the people who are going, either by working with them or being on the same team.<br />
Today I said goodbye to three good friends: Dave, Mike, and Jen.<br />
Dave was the one who interviewed me when I first walked through Critical Mass&#8217; doors just over a year ago. I remember the interview well, thinking I was in a lot of trouble because I couldn&#8217;t figure out what he wanted. Dave&#8217;s got a good poker face. It wasn&#8217;t until we struck upon movies that he seemed to lighten up. Not a month later, I was seated a desk away from Dave, and since then have been fortunate to know Dave quite well. We spent several very long days and nights during the summer working on our respective projects, often staying until the wee hours of the morning alternating between coding and acting goofy.<br />
Mike was also in my department, but because he sat in a different area, I really didn&#8217;t get to know him until a couple of months after I got here. Mike&#8217;s wit and passion for independent films was what set him apart from most people, as did his fascination (some call it obsession) with strange video games like &#8220;Samba De Amigo&#8221;.<br />
I first met Jen on the night before we were to deliver a pitch for a potential client. She and Chris had been engaged in heavy conversation when I arrived. We found that she shared the same birthday as Chris and I, which created some sort of strange bond between the three of us. Jen and I have since seen a couple of Tuesday night movies (&#8220;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#8221; and &#8220;Chocolat&#8221;) and had a few deep conversations of our own. I&#8217;ve known Jen for only just over four months, but it feels like it&#8217;s been much longer.<br />
I&#8217;ve been preparing for this day for a long time, but it seems so surreal to have it finally arrive. Not an hour ago, I watched Dave and Mike drive away into the night, knowing that there would be no more game nights with them, no more breakfasts or lunches, no more movies. Soon, I will say goodbye to Jen, and she, too, will disappear into the night. No more deep conversations over pints of Guinness about movies or strange things that have happened in our lives.<br />
They&#8217;re still a part of Critical Mass, but they might as well have moved to the other side of the world for all it really matters. They&#8217;re not here.<br />
Last night, I went out with Dave for his second-to-last night in Calgary. I drank more than I would normally, probably to dull the pain. Tonight, I found myself doing the same again. Were I more sober, I would realise how much it hurts. I did my best to laugh and joke as Dave and Mike drove away, all the time feeling my insides twisting up into a single tight knot.<br />
Tomorrow, I will come to work, and see three empty desks where my friends used to sit. I&#8217;ll see their ghosts for days, maybe even weeks to come. Sure, there will always be email, but it&#8217;s never quite the same as being with them. This I know from experience.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say goodbye to good friends.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s been one of those years. I really hope I don&#8217;t have to go through another one like that again. Clichéd though it be, it was a year for rediscovery &#8212; mostly of myself. I lost my self-identity in Vancouver, allowing myself to be overwhelmed by another. It takes a while to rebuild that sort of thing. It&#8217;s not done yet, but having gone through that I know now what to avoid should I ever be so stupid as to get myself into that situation again&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a weird week. Imagine trying to do &#8220;business as usual&#8221; knowing full well that in a week you&#8217;d be working out of a new office. That&#8217;s pretty much what last week was like.<br />
Critical Mass is big. As of next week, we&#8217;ll have 252 people &#8230; in Calgary. That doesn&#8217;t count the Chicago, New York, or Stockholm offices. (We&#8217;ll be even bigger once we open the Toronto office. That actually scares some people.) We ran out of space in our old building a long time ago &#8212; it was almost to the point where we would have to start stacking desks just to get everyone in.<br />
So many moons ago, our Operations Manager starting hunting for a new space. That&#8217;s not easy in Calgary &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of office space around, but it&#8217;s either occupied or WAY too dull for a &#8220;leading edge interactive marketing agency&#8221;, which I think is how we describe ourselves.<br />
The search went on for months before (somehow) we started negotiations with Mogens Smed, one of the leading interior designers for office spaces. Funky furniture, comfy chairs, and nothing that would be considered really &#8220;corporate&#8221;. It&#8217;s kinda like a step up from IKEA furniture, which is what we had. (Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with IKEA).<br />
Smed bought a building just north of the Stampede grounds that had been abandoned for many years. With Critical Mass providing direction (as we were to be the sole occupants), Smed transformed the old Pilkington Glass Company factory into the World Headquarters for Critical Mass.<br />
In six months.<br />
Frankly, I&#8217;m amazed they pulled it off. As Ted (our Chairman) remarked during today&#8217;s &#8220;tour&#8221;, it was an 18-month job done in a third of the time. But you wouldn&#8217;t know to look around. It&#8217;s a quality job. It&#8217;s also a bit getting used to &#8212; everything&#8217;s so &#8230; new. And unused. Kinda like a Star Trek episode&#8230;<br />
The trick, of course, was to get us from our old building and settled into our new building in as little time as possible. That was what happened during the weekend. With a significant amount of prep work by our administration staff, we packed and labelled every single last item in the office, right down to the spare paper clips, before Friday. On Friday morning, everyone came in, packed up their desks into plastic bins, wrapped up their computers, and left by about 9:30am. After that, it was all up to the movers.<br />
We came in around 2:00 in the afternoon on Sunday, on a directive from Ted, to unpack our bins and set up our desks. Aside from a few small things, everything arrived intact an unharmed. Even more shocking was when I got in this morning &#8212; except for our LDAP server, we were up and running. All the phones, the mail server, the Internet connection &#8212; everything. It was all up. Mind you, it wasn&#8217;t without its glitches, but when you consider that the office was moved in a weekend to a new location, and it all works, well &#8230; that&#8217;s a pretty amazing feat.<br />
We have a really interesting deal with Smed. They own the building, and all the furniture inside. We own the computers. We get a really cool office (for a lot less than we should), and Smed gets a really cool company to occupy the space. Smed gets to drag in companies like Coca-Cola to show them what a cool space looks like, and if we happen to pitch a website to them at the same time, well, that&#8217;s business.<br />
Hollywood scripts aren&#8217;t planned this well. (Especially this year&#8230;)<br />
With slightly over two weeks left before I duck out for Ontario for Christmas, the next couple of weeks are going to be really hectic.<br />
But at least I can go insane in a cool building&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Things have been pretty quiet since the summer &#8212; not a lot of activity, not a heck of a lot to report. But this is a habit I&#8217;ve gotta keep up, if for nothing else so that I&#8217;ll be in practice if/when this Japan thing pans out. Although admittedly, I&#8217;ll probably have much more to talk about then.<br />
Our weekend more-or-less began at 12:45pm on Thursday. That was when we heard: &#8220;Anyone who can hear this, get your butts over the Danish Community Hall now!&#8221; That was the call for our &#8220;Town Hall Meeting&#8221;, a gathering of the Calgary office in one place. Once upon a time (before I started), we could actually congregate in one place in the office. Doesn&#8217;t happen anymore &#8212; we have to go across the street to the DCH so we can hear the speeches.<br />
We hold these about every six months. It&#8217;s mostly so everyone can have an inkling of what&#8217;s going on. (We&#8217;ve got a lot of people spread across a lot of projects &#8212; there&#8217;s no way for everyone to know everything. That&#8217;s not to say, of course, that I don&#8217;t try.) All 250-odd people crammed into the Valhalla Hall for four hours of cheesy speeches, reviews on our projects, really dull organizational ponderings, and an auction.<br />
Yes, an auction. Ted, one of our founders and the company Chairman (Chairperson, whatever!) and the other members of the senior management auctioned off a gourmet meal for 12 people. It&#8217;s a fundraiser (believe it or not) for charity. They wine and dine you, you fork out a lot of money, which when combined with money from Critical Mass (the company), goes towards sending underprivileged to camp in Westbank. (Ted&#8217;s got a thing for Westbank&#8230;) Many people got together in groups of 12 to try and bid for the prize. I say &#8220;try&#8221; because within only a minute or so, the price surpassed anything we grunts could afford &#8212; it was a battle between our CTO and our Director of Project Management. When the dust settled, Ted said the dinner was now for 24, and took both groups. All told, about $22,000 is going to kids. Not bad for five minutes&#8217; work, eh?<br />
The meeting over, we were instructed to attending a post-Town Hall reception at Ceili&#8217;s (it&#8217;s Gaelic, so you pronounce it &#8220;Cayley&#8217;s&#8221;) &#8212; a pub a couple blocks away. By 8pm, the only sober person was Chris. Everyone else was quite inebriated. Luckily for us, Ted had told us we didn&#8217;t have to come in at our regular time (8am) the following morning. This was good. Most people didn&#8217;t show up until 10am. A few didn&#8217;t straggle in until 2pm &#8212; they didn&#8217;t look so good.<br />
Friday night, we met with up with Therese and Stuart (who were somewhat fresh from their trip to Vancouver &#8212; they must&#8217;ve really enjoyed themselves, we&#8217;ve heard much of their escapades; I&#8217;ve listened intently, and been able to picture exactly where they&#8217;ve been and how it looks &#8212; I have to admit that I still miss it) to see &#8220;Pay It Forward&#8221;, one of the better movies this year. Haley Joel Osmet (the kid) is one of these once-in-a-lifetime wunderkinds who either go onto huge success or burn out trying. I sincerely hope it&#8217;s more the former than the latter&#8230;<br />
On Saturday, I had the pleasure of keeping an eye on my little cousin, Jen. Hmm&#8230; &#8220;Little&#8221; isn&#8217;t a good word. Let&#8217;s go with &#8220;younger&#8221;. Jen&#8217;s 16 years younger than me. She&#8217;s less than an inch shorter than me. Notice a problem with this? For some reason that I&#8217;ll never understand, the Western side of my family seems to have mutant children that grow to huge heights. Must be the water.<br />
Deciding that I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having her trounce all over me on her N64 all evening, I suggested that I take her to a movie. At first, she wasn&#8217;t too keen, but when I suggested playing video games before the movie, she ran for her coat. The movie was &#8220;The Little Vampire&#8221;. It&#8217;s a cute little movie, though I wasn&#8217;t sure how Jen would respond to it. She&#8217;s at that &#8220;pre-teenager&#8221; stage where kid things are no longer cool, but I&#8217;m not comfortable with dragging her into most of the other movies currently out (although she&#8217;s seen &#8220;Meet The Parents&#8221; and loved it).<br />
We played &#8220;Gauntlet&#8221; (the new version &#8212; Jen&#8217;s too young to remember the original) for two hours. Straight. We hurt afterwards&#8230;<br />
Sunday started with dim sum. It&#8217;s almost a ritual for Chris and I &#8212; one more week, and we&#8217;ll have a set pattern that&#8217;ll be hard to break. However, we&#8217;ve run into one itty bitty problem with it &#8212; the line-up seems to be getting bigger every week. Dunno why &#8212; it was fine up until two weeks ago. We need to start going earlier. Stuart and Therese were a bit surprised at the line-up, too, and they&#8217;ve been to Silver Dragon far more often than Chris and I.<br />
The best part about weekends is having no plans. So when Therese suggested we go &#8220;window shopping&#8221;, we eagerly piled into Stuart and Therese&#8217;s new Volkswagen Jetta (complete with possibly the best-sounding stereo I&#8217;ve ever heard in a car) and drove south to Chinook Mall. There, Chris proceeded to attempt to buy something from every store. Of course, that&#8217;s an exaggeration &#8212; he&#8217;s not *that* bad&#8230; Therese and I somehow managed to make it out of the mall unscathed, financially-speaking, that is. Chris won the award for most stuff, and for most unusual &#8212; a replica of the old vinyl airline bags of the &#8217;60s. Why? Dunno. It&#8217;s a Chris thing&#8230;<br />
Speaking of airlines, Chris and I will be returning to the wilds of Ontario for Christmas this year, on (or around) the 20th. Tickets have been booked and paid for, so there&#8217;s no holding us back. Unless somebody chains the plane to the ground, that is&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is a hard-working company. And Ted (our founder and corporate Chairman) knows it. To &#8220;thank&#8221; us for all the grief he puts us through, he closes (more or less) the office for two days, packs us off to some remote part of the country, and gets us all horribly drunk &#8212; and he pays for everything. It might be good to be king, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to be a peasant every once in a while.<br />
Critical Mass starts planning &#8220;The Trip&#8221;, as it&#8217;s usually referred to, about four months early. It&#8217;s a fairly involved excursion, and when you consider the attendance (at least this year) is about 300 people, there&#8217;s a fair bit of coordination involved. We have two people who work on it nearly full-time, in addition to their regular jobs. And then there&#8217;s a team of about 10 people (representing the various departments in the company) who help in the decision making for things such as, well, the beer labels.<br />
Yes, beer labels. This was something I participated in. We had a beer label competition. If you buy enough beer from the Big Rock Brewery here in Calgary, you can make your own special labels for the event. When I first heard about the opportunity to see if I could out-design the Design department, I leapt a the chance. I came in second. Behind Adrian. A guy who works in Design. Oh well, maybe next year.<br />
We arrived at Critical Mass on Thursday morning with bags in hand, ready for the nine-odd hour trip to Westbank, British Columbia. (For those of you who&#8217;ve never heard of Westbank, it&#8217;s a little south of Kelowna, on the east side of Lake Okanagan.) Luckily, we were not taking school busses (I can only imaging the agony of sitting in those for more than three hours at a time) &#8212; were taking Greyhound.<br />
The busses started arriving around 8:00am. We were told they would arrive at 7:30am. This was a tactic to make sure we all were there on time. As it stands, the fourth (and last) bus didn&#8217;t arrive until nearly 8:45, and we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 9:00 (despite the threatened 8:30 departure time). Again, all of this was planned with an iota of experience &#8212; I assume they had problems last year, and figured it would be worse this time around.<br />
Luckily, our Greyhound busses came equipped with all the modern conveniences: Reclining seats, air conditioning, and a VCR with two TVs. That meant movies. And what better movies to travel with than the Indiana Jones trilogy? Well, if you&#8217;re Mike (on of my co-workers, and a huge fan of independent films), it also includes &#8220;Waiting for Guffman&#8221;. Mike, it seems, was the only one really interested in it. I would have preferred to see &#8220;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&#8221; instead, which was bumped when Mike beat us to the VCR.<br />
We made three stops along the way &#8212; a quick one at some rest stop, one at Golden for lunch, and a third one in some rinky-dink place north of Vernon so all the smokers on the busses wouldn&#8217;t shake it apart from nic-fits. Every time we had a stop, Pat (whom we labelled &#8220;Bus Masta P&#8221; &#8212; he was in charge of all the busses) got stressed out trying to keep everyone on schedule by getting them back on. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll willingly do that again next year.<br />
We arrived at the Cove Resort around 5:30pm PDT. Now, before you get all &#8220;oooh, a resort!&#8221;, this is at best a word that would describe the long-term plans. There&#8217;s no shuffleboard, no sailboats, no beach &#8212; not even anything remotely resembling a restaurant. It&#8217;s an old farm converted to 26 cabins and a small motel-like building. My cabin, in fact, used to be the farm house. Even all those cabins couldn&#8217;t house our bulk &#8212; we needed the large field to accommodate an additional 20 or so tents.<br />
There were no real plans that evening, aside from getting settled (which took a while &#8212; we had a lot of stuff to unload from the busses), eat (which we did, around 7:00 that evening), drink (which we did in abundance), and relax (which came after the aforementioned drinking). Many of us congregated at Cabin #6, home of the Conners Brothers and Colin &#8212; a perfect recipe for trouble, especially when four tenters were regularly crashing on the cabin floor rather than sleeping outside. Cabin #6 became legend by the following morning.<br />
I didn&#8217;t rise until nearly 1pm, opting to catch up on a lot of sleep. The day was warm and sunny, and people were milling about. I headed to the main tent, where I hoped lunch was being served (I didn&#8217;t really know what time it was, I didn&#8217;t know for most of the weekend). I was in luck &#8212; lunch was slowly beginning to end, and snatching up a meal was as simple as walking up to the table and taking whatever I wanted.<br />
The day was slow and lazy &#8212; the way a day should be. Others went off in search of amenities such as McDonald&#8217;s and Starbucks. I went off in search of things I could watch. I opted not to actually participate in anything, trying not to do anything physically active at all. (This was a conscious decision &#8230; it came right after I realized I&#8217;d forgotten my swimsuit.) There were plenty of things for me to watch &#8212; people were playing sports all over the place, including horseshoes, bocce, volleyball, soccer, and touch football.<br />
The &#8220;major&#8221; event of the day was the wakeboarding demonstration. Ted (who lives barely five minutes from the Resort) is basically a big kid, and is always looking for new toys and things to do. (This is why we also had a houseboat that would take us on short rides on the lake, and Ted took extreme pleasure in whipping people around in his new super-fast powerboat.) Ted hired professional wakeboarders (some of whom had placed as high as fifth in Wakestock, the wakeboarding championships) to not only show us what they could do, but teach others to do it as well.<br />
The demonstration sucked.<br />
Okay, to be fair, they were good. The only problem was that their best demonstration was nearly half a kilometre away, and nearly impossible to see. Our cheering could be best described as &#8220;reserved&#8221;.<br />
Hamburgers were on the menu that night. We were lucky &#8212; our meals were provided by a catering company (who did an excellent job). Last year, those who went on the trip were preparing their own meals. Relaxation is much easier when you only need to show up and eat.<br />
Entertainment for the first night in Westbank was courtesy of several &#8220;amateur&#8221; (though they certainly sound professional) DJs who work in various parts of the company. The second night&#8217;s entertainment was also musical, but certainly more &#8230; interesting.<br />
Karaoke.<br />
Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;You did karaoke??&#8221; Well, *I* didn&#8217;t do karaoke, but just about everyone else did. Why didn&#8217;t I? Aside from a terminal case of stage fright, I also happen to be extremely self-conscious about my inability to sing. Hey, when you take a jab at yourself in front of your friends (such as &#8220;I sing horribly&#8221;), and they don&#8217;t respond the way friends normally do (such as &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not *that* bad&#8221;), you know you suck.<br />
Mike (the guy with the independent film fetish) was anxious to get on stage and show his stuff. (Mike&#8217;s a little weird.) He wasn&#8217;t the first on stage. That was Geoff Mackenzie.<br />
Geoff&#8217;s a character. (Must be in the name.) He was dressed in jeans (pants and jacket), a somewhat-loud cowboy-like shirt, and a corduroy cowboy hat. The first song of the evening was &#8220;Stand By Your Man&#8221;. And no, he didn&#8217;t change the lyrics one bit. Geoff&#8217;s performance (with heavy doses of ham) set the tone for the evening, and it went downhill from there.<br />
Chris (my roommate, friend, and fellow troublemaker) was up shortly after Geoff. Chris erupted onto the stage with an opening that went somewhat like this: &#8220;Aight, they didn&#8217;t have any NWA, so instead, this one goes out to all my Critical Mass niggaz and all my Critical Mass shortys. Let&#8217;s roll up on this motherf***er&#8230;&#8221; He did Lionel Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Easy (Like Sunday Morning)&#8221;. With audience participation. Shannon, another of my co-workers who knows Chris, was sitting on the balcony outside his motel room (there was a motel-like building that housed another six rooms of people) was duly impressed with Chris&#8217; performance. It led to a return to the stage for a duet with Rob (who&#8217;s in Design, I think) to do &#8220;Ebony and Ivory&#8221;. Rob and Chris lapped up the audience&#8217;s appreciation.<br />
During a needed sprint back to my cabin (bathroom break), I missed the opening of one of the headlining acts for the night: Ted and Dewi. They brought their own music (they figured the karaoke company wouldn&#8217;t have the song they wanted to do) &#8212; Backstreet Boys&#8217; &#8220;Larger Than Life&#8221;. Only they had help &#8212; four others who did the now-famous chair dance while Ted and Dewi crooned. (I should point out that this was not only set up well in advance, but the chair dancers practiced their moves before strutting their stuff in public.) The audience might as well have been from an actual Backstreet Boys concert from the amount of screaming and cheering&#8230;<br />
Geoff came back for another round of fun, performing that Johnny Cash classic, &#8220;Ring of Fire&#8221;. You&#8217;d never think so many people would be so into karaoke. I guess it all depends on who&#8217;s up performing. I think I have a whole new appreciation for that brand of entertainment. For example, we staged the first ever Tiffany mosh pit when two singing souls (Steve and Andrew) did their rendition of &#8220;I Think We&#8217;re Alone Now&#8221;. It was a sign of things to come.<br />
Anyway, Geoff stole the show again, and then managed to get everyone in the tent to break a few hundred noise by-laws by screaming at the top of their lungs. I think my Aunt Alaine and Uncle David (who live on the other side of the lake) could probably have heard us that evening. Luckily, the cops never showed up.<br />
The fight for the limelight also included Shawn Conners (one of the Conners Brothers). Shawn is about as perfect a specimen of a (pardon the language) &#8220;shit disturber&#8221; as I have ever met. He is also an artiste (note the extra &#8216;e&#8217;) and the biggest honey-glazed ham I have ever had the pleasure to have known. He and Colin did a great version of Milli Vanilli&#8217;s &#8220;Blame It On The Rain&#8221;. But Shawn wasn&#8217;t content with a simple singing version &#8212; he had to go that one step further and dump a bottle of water on himself (very much like in &#8220;Flashdance&#8221; &#8212; I still think they should have been doing &#8220;What A Feeling&#8221;) while striking an overly-dramatic pose.<br />
I made a hasty departure when Dave and his posse started singing &#8220;American Pie&#8221;. Keith&#8217;s a great singer, but it was a riot just waiting to happen. I hung out at the fire pit for a while, talking with some of the people who had fled the chaos, before retreating to Cabin #6 sometime around 1am, after the karaoke had broken down into a rave.<br />
I woke earlier the next morning and found my way to the big tent, where others were waiting for lunch. Breakfast had just ended, but I didn&#8217;t miss anything (muffins and fruit salad every morning were not enough of a reason for me to get up early). Lunch that day were smokies, and the tent was packed with hungry people waiting to eat.<br />
The afternoon was relaxed again. Some people slept, many others disappeared into town again, in search of amenities. Several went to see &#8220;X-Men&#8221; playing at the local cheapie theatre. I wandered around, talked with people, watched others try to wakeboard, sat around the campfire (which I think never went out from the moment it was lit), and watched others play cards.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t bored. Boredom comes when you want to do something, but are unable to determine what it is you want to do. I was trying to avoid activity. I was letting my mind turn to mush for a while. By purposely not thinking or doing anything, I was letting myself relax. I haven&#8217;t done it in a very long time, and it was hugely relaxing.<br />
One thing that required the use of my brain somewhat was reading the paper. Someone had left a copy of the Vancouver Sun on the table in my cabin, and I figured I&#8217;d see what was going down in the Lower Mainland. Aside from a massive sewer rupture spilling millions of litres of untreated sewage into Burrard Inlet, it seemed that not much had changed since I left &#8212; same political name-calling, same sports successes, and school was back in session (you know it&#8217;s a slow news day when&#8230;) It was very comforting to read a newspaper &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t read one since I was staying at my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s here in Calgary.<br />
The weather wasn&#8217;t cooperating one bit. While the previous day had been nice (although the night had been quite cold), we had bursts of rain for most of the day. Although right before dinner, we found ourselves gazing at the largest and most vivid double-rainbow I&#8217;ve ever seen. I&#8217;ve never seen a complete rainbow before, either &#8212; usually the top or either end is missing, but this one was a complete 180-degree arc. It was awe-inspiring. The joke that immediately followed was a query about how much Ted paid to have a rainbow appear before dinner.<br />
Our last supper in Westbank was steak and salmon, with baked potatoes and Caesar salad. Those of us who could, pigged out. Aside from the bones, it was great. (Although we apparently ran out of salmon, and I feel a little guilty for getting as much as I did. Only a little &#8212; it was Pacific salmon, after all.)<br />
Dessert was a special one that night. It was Ted&#8217;s birthday, and we had three cakes to spread around. Two of the cakes bore our Critical Mass propaganda logo, the third bore a relief sculpture of a caricature of Ted&#8217;s face. In icing. It was beautiful &#8230; and the artist (Mark Gervais) didn&#8217;t get fired for it.<br />
It was Caribbean night. This meant loud polyester shirts, shorts, and lots and lots and lots and lots of booze. (We went through between 9,000 and 13,000 pounds of booze in the weekend.) The Caribbean music (although good), lasted only long enough to get Ted (who was a little past plastered) to take a few swings at a piñata. Then the DJs got back into their swing, and the rave got going again. This was probably the most intense it had been since we got there, but most people realized that this was their last night to really let loose. And most of them did.<br />
Not being a dancer, nor finding anything else to do at that point, I found myself back at the fire pit again. Our group of six (comprising nearly every level and department in the company) engaged in hearty conversation. Our numbers soon swelled, when Ted arrived. (Wherever Ted goes, people go. It&#8217;s either an Einsteinian thing where people flow to the gravity well formed by Ted&#8217;s immense power, or they&#8217;re drawn like moths to candle flames. Either way, we soon had a lot of people.<br />
Ted was a little dismayed to find it was only 10:50. He had hoped it was 12:50. He wanted to go home, but thought it would be &#8230; well, wimpy of him to leave before 1am. Ted was wiped &#8212; the day had really taken a dent out of him, and he had two more hours to survive. Soon, there were about 50 people around the fire, and I&#8217;d lost my seat.<br />
Around midnight, the Rave Revolt began. First it started with Ted commenting that they&#8217;d played the same song for over three hours. Dan went over to &#8220;correct&#8221; the problem. He reported back (sans a change in music) saying Dewi protested, offering a change after &#8220;the first set&#8221;. Some of the more &#8220;senior&#8221; people (those over the age of 35) didn&#8217;t much like this answer. Ted decided it was time for action, and walked back towards the tent, muttering something about &#8220;Christmas bonuses&#8221;. A few minutes later, lyrics returned to the music, and the beat was noticeably different.<br />
It&#8217;s something that I think the older folk don&#8217;t quite understand. Rave music is meant to have a single beat that lasts for hours. It&#8217;s a challenge to keep the beat while changing the songs. The beat, although important, isn&#8217;t everything &#8212; melodies change, different layers of sound are woven in and out, even some lyrics thrown in for good measure. But it&#8217;s a sign of a skilled DJ who can make several hours of music sound like one song.<br />
By about 2:30 in the morning, there were only nine: Chris, myself, Ben, Adrian, Virgil, Mike (different Mike), Teak, Simone, and Marcie. We talked. All night. Our first major topic of conversations was 80s TV themes. Ben is the King of 80s TV. He knows the themes from virtually every TV show that aired from 1979 to 1991, except the really obscure ones like Automan, Manimal, Outlaws, and The Highwayman (bonus points to you if you a) even remember what they were, and double points if b) you can describe them.)<br />
Marcie and Simone left shortly before we finished that topic, saying &#8220;it&#8217;s time for bed&#8221;. Adrian suggested we do movie quotes &#8212; you give the quote, and the rest had to guess it. Chris and I had a decided advantage, having a) watched about a billion movies, and b) spent a great deal of time memorizing lines. For everyone who thought we were wasting our time, I offer you the fruits of our labour. Of course, Chris and I were always telling each other not to speak up, because we knew that the other would know the quote.<br />
Yeah, yeah, we act like we&#8217;re married. Like we haven&#8217;t heard that a thousand times before. It doesn&#8217;t help that we&#8217;ve been good friends for 13 years.<br />
Somewhere around 3:30am, Simone and Marcie returned to our circle, not having made it to bed. They&#8217;d been distracted by another social gathering elsewhere (assumedly not one as geeky as ours), but instead of going to bed when it broke up, they came back to us. (So I guess we&#8217;re not that geeky. No comments from the peanut gallery!)<br />
Somewhere around 4:00am or so, it began to rain. A lot. It was the sort of rain you knew would get you utterly soaked. And with the wind picking up, it was going to get us cold very quickly. We retreated to the big tent. We flipped on the lights, cranked up the heater, and returned to our little games. Ben bailed on us about 30 minutes later, leaving just the Group of Eight.<br />
When morning finally arrived, we started the process of getting ready to leave. Chris and I showered, packed, and hauled our stuff out to the Resort office porch, awaiting arrival of the busses. We then ate breakfast (muffins and fruit salad) and watched the sun come up. Figures that the day we leave good weather returns to Westbank.<br />
When the busses showed up, people started jumping on them. That started trouble. People (in general) are stupid. People don&#8217;t think about big pictures, what needs to be done, bla bla bla. That&#8217;s why we have visionaries. And anal retentive busy-bodies. (They&#8217;re often one-in-the-same, but that&#8217;s another long essay.) This is when I called upon the bus leaders to get their acts in gear, or we weren&#8217;t getting all the sound equipment, leftovers, and tents onto the busses.<br />
Chrissie (now the designated Bus Master), quickly knighted me and gave me the power to order others around. Holding everyone else back, we loaded our leftovers and whatnot onto the busses before letting everyone else suck up the rest of the space with their belongings. Packing took about 30 minutes.<br />
Chris was nowhere in sight. Having made mention to it earlier in the day (or later in the night before, take your choice), he had probably grabbed a seat with Marcie. (I would find out I was right after our first stop in Revelstoke.) I was seated behind Yasmin, one of our new people &#8212; she&#8217;s an Information Architect, and in front of Rich, one of our Project Managers. Along with most of the bus, we slept most of the way back to Calgary.<br />
We watched three movies: &#8220;Dumb and Dumber&#8221;, &#8220;Big Trouble In Little China&#8221;, and part of &#8220;True Lies&#8221;. When I was awake, I wasn&#8217;t watching the movies most of the time &#8212; I was watching the scenery. The day was so bright, and I wasn&#8217;t driving, that I got my first really good look at the sights to be seen in the mountains. There were a few times that I wished I could have stopped the bus just so I could look around.<br />
Arriving in Calgary, chaos ensued when we unloaded. But soon Chris and I were safe and sound at home. Overall, it was a great weekend, except for the 18 hours spent on the road. Those were a little more tedious. But I can think of worse things &#8212; 18 hours across the Prairies, for example.<br />
This morning, people were tired, foggy, semi-unconcious &#8212; basically everything you&#8217;d expect from such a weekend. Productivity will take a day or two to get back to normal. Whatever normal is&#8230;<br />
One last note: It was minus one this morning as I walked to work. The shorts are gone, the fleece is out, and the sandals are bare moments from being packed away. Summer is definitely over.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It all started when I received an email during my stay in Cincinnati. (This was a couple of weeks ago, obviously.) It was entitled &#8220;Kicking Horse Blazing Paddles&#8221;. It was a call for those interested in experiencing the adrenaline of whitewater rafting on the Kicking Horse River.<br />
I need not mention that I was interested&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;d never been whitewater rafting before, but I knew a few people who had, and they all loved it. So, naturally, my curiosity was piqued enough to be interested, and certainly the opportunity to try something more invigorating than a rollercoaster was enthralling. I had my named added to the list of other half-suicidal CMassers.<br />
As it turned out, there would only be six of us: Sean (who organized the trip), his brother Robin, Shannon, Sara, and Sara&#8217;s significant other, Brett. We had hoped for eight, at which point we could get a group discount, but we settled with our six and hoped for the best trip we could get under the circumstances.<br />
What about Chris? Well, Chris has a love/hate relationship with water. He doesn&#8217;t much like it outside of showers (although he&#8217;s taken up a healthy swimming regiment as of late). He also hates the cold. Really hates the cold. Loathes the cold. His response to my invitation to join us was:</p>
<blockquote><p>HAHAHAAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHH.<br />
Ha.<br />
Your [sic] a funny f&#8211;king lad&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We met early Saturday morning in the Critical Mass parking lot. Sean and his brother would drive in one car, Shannon and I in my car, and Sara and Brett in their SUV. Sean informed us that morning that we might in fact be late &#8212; there was the possibility that the drive could take upwards of four hours. Our trip was scheduled for noon. We were going to have to move fast.<br />
We left the parking lot, turned onto 10th Ave. SW, turned up 8th St., and then onto 6th Ave. Robin led us out to Sarcee Trail, which then took us to 16th Ave. (aka Trans Canada Highway), and then out of the city. For the next two hours, we stuck together like glue: Robin and Sean in front, Shannon and I in the middle, and Sara and Brett picking up the rear. This wasn&#8217;t particularly easy, since we hit speeds as high as 140 km/h making sure we got to our destination in time.<br />
Our destination was the Kootenay River Runners company, located on the Kicking Horse River about halfway between Field, BC and Golden, BC. This would be my first trip into British Columbia in almost four months. Admittedly, I was a little apprehensive at first, but I cast aside that irrational fear and plunged headlong&#8230;<br />
&#8230;into rain.<br />
Lots of it. Figures &#8212; I was going to BC, after all.<br />
It rained from almost the moment we left Calgary until just after we&#8217;d crossed the Kicking Horse Pass. So in a strange way, it wasn&#8217;t really raining *in* BC. Odd, isn&#8217;t it?<br />
The trip there was marked with Shannon and I discussing favourite movies, and me giving a brief history of Canadian development in the Rockies to Shannon. He didn&#8217;t know a lot about the area, and I guess I know more than I should. But he seemed interested, and (as most of you who know me will testify) I like to talk.<br />
We arrived at the Kootenay River Runner&#8217;s Whitewater Ranch at about 11:15 &#8212; way ahead of everyone else. We were listed as &#8220;early&#8221;. This gave us the chance to look around a little. The Whitewater Ranch is not as fancy as it sounds. Basically, it&#8217;s nothing more than a large shed (which houses most of the equipment and two washroom/change rooms), a couple of miscellaneous sheds, a half-completed barbecue shelter, and a large section of flood plain where the rafts waited to whisk us downriver.<br />
My first stop (after using the toilet) was to the river. The Kicking Horse River, like most of the rivers in the Rockies, is a glacial river. English translation: Frickin&#8217; cold. About one degree Celsius. Yes Virginia, it&#8217;s that cold. The river isn&#8217;t clear &#8212; it&#8217;s powder blue. This is from all the ice crystals suspended in the water. (This is also why glacial lakes, like Lake Louise, are blue.) And yes, it was very cold.<br />
People soon started arriving, and we opted to change into our rafting wear: Bathing suits and t-shirts. I gave up my sandals for my winter boots (basically over-grown shoes), as I wasn&#8217;t too keen on putting my bare feet into that river at any time. The guides (specifically one guy who we learned was called &#8220;Rhino&#8221; &#8212; he never told us why he was called that) and given the low-down on equipment.<br />
Our attire would not be limited to our swimsuits and t-shirts, for obvious reasons. (Namely, we&#8217;d develop hypothermia in less than a minute in these waters). Our first layer would be a swimsuit (or nothing at all), on top of which would be a wet suit. It wasn&#8217;t a full wetsuit, the top looked like neoprene overalls. On top of that would go a nylon fleece top, and a &#8220;spray jacket&#8221; on top of that (basically a slightly rubberized nylon shell). On top of that would be our life jacket. Our feet would have either neoprene &#8220;socks&#8221; or boots (or shoes, for those of us who couldn&#8217;t get the socks or boots). Lastly would be a helmet, so we wouldn&#8217;t knock ourselves silly on the rocks &#8230; or each other.<br />
Suiting up didn&#8217;t take too long, although some people had problems with the wetsuits, and one guy near me could not get the small fleece top over his extra large body. It was quite amusing to watch, though.<br />
After tossing our things onto one of two buses (we were only doing the Upper Kicking Horse portion of the river; roughly half of the group was also doing the Lower portion), we headed down to the river. There we got the safety speech. This is important. This is where you learn the basics of whitewater survival. Most of the time, you probably don&#8217;t need this speech &#8212; it&#8217;s for the worst-case scenarios.<br />
I&#8217;m glad we got it.<br />
The six of us ended up on raft #17. It&#8217;s a SOTAR (&#8220;State Of The Art Raft&#8221;), which basically means short of a nuclear blast, it&#8217;ll survive almost anything the river can offer. Our guide, Eric, was a nine-year veteran of river guiding, and had been guiding on this river for several years. He drove in from Vegreville (about five hours away) every weekend to send another group of hapless weekend warriors downriver to experience the thrill of freezing to death.<br />
Okay, it&#8217;s not *that* bad&#8230;<br />
Before boarding, we had to finish adjusting our lifejackets. Most people who use them (not all do) wear them pretty loosely. In most cases, this is probably fine. However, if you&#8217;re going whitewater rafting, particularly in such cold water, the lifejacket has to be tight &#8230; so tight it&#8217;s difficult to breathe. Why? Because if you fall out of the boat, they use the jacket to haul you back in. Eric had to tie Sara&#8217;s jacket on extra tight &#8212; she&#8217;s not a large person, and she was swimming inside the flotation device.<br />
We piled in, Shannon and I in the bow, Brett and Sara behind us, Eric in the middle, Sean and Robin behind him, and a recently-married elderly couple behind them (I only learned the man&#8217;s name, Neil). After a quick shove-off, we started our journey.<br />
Eric reiterated the safety speech, just to make sure we all understood what was going on. He then sent us through some simple drills. Forward and backward paddling, alternating sides paddling, diving to one side or the other &#8212; basic things to get us down river. The key was to paddle in sync, which meant Shannon and I would spend more time watching each other than the river. This would come back to haunt us.<br />
The first portion of the river was fairly tame &#8212; the odd ripple, a couple of nice currents, but nothing major. Then Eric sent us into (what I guess is) a Class II rapid. Shannon and I got soaked. It was cold. Really cold. But unlike jumping into cold water and starting to hyperventilate, it wasn&#8217;t paralysing. After a couple of moments, the water warmed a bit (as a wetsuit is supposed to) and it became less uncomfortable. Sara, who was sitting behind me, wasn&#8217;t quite as comfortable &#8212; she hadn&#8217;t done up the collar on her spray jacket and got a few cups of ice-cold water down the front.<br />
About 45 minutes after leaving Whitewater Ranch, we pulled over at the side of the river for lunch. By this point we were hucking our lifejackets to try and cool off. It was quite warm with those things on so tight. Waiting for us was hot coffee, hot water (with packets of hot chocolate powder), and lunch &#8230; though the guides had to help setting it all up. Soon, lunch was called and we dropped into line to get it.<br />
Lunch was pretty simple &#8212; make-your-own sandwiches, pickles, caesar salad, cantaloupe, and cookies. The website had said there would be a barbecue, but the shelter wasn&#8217;t complete, so we didn&#8217;t get to partake in that. Maybe next time&#8230;<br />
Lunch wasn&#8217;t particularly lavish, but it was filling enough to occupy the voids beginning to form in our stomachs. The group of 60 (or so) filled out the small clearing, munching away and discussing the first leg of the trip. Some of us knew what was in store for the second leg (we&#8217;d already been filled in by co-workers who&#8217;d done the trip the year before), and were excited to get back on the water.<br />
Especially since we were beginning to get cold. The lifejackets were great insulation from the cold, which was now beginning to set in. We couldn&#8217;t wait to get buckled back in and paddling to warm up.<br />
We shifted seats a bit when we headed back out. Shannon moved back to where Sean was sitting, I moved to where Shannon was sitting, and Sean moved to where I was sitting. Didn&#8217;t change much beyond that. I had to switch to the other side because my right arm was beginning to hurt a bit, and I wanted to give my left a chance.<br />
Soon we were off, back into smaller rapids, getting wet, and having fun. Only about five minutes out, we pulled off to the side again. Eric claimed he had to get out and &#8220;get his bearings&#8221;. I think this is code for the guides to figure out where the largest wave is to scare the bejeebers out of the beginners in the raft. We were about to enter Shotgun Alley.<br />
This is a section of the Kicking Horse where rocks have created the most intense rapids in the Upper section of the river. They max out at Class V (out of a maximum of Class X). We couldn&#8217;t see around the corner, and so had no idea what we were about to get into. Eric came back, saying he knew what he was going to do, so loaded us up, and away we went.<br />
Shotgun doesn&#8217;t look as bad as it actually is &#8230; at least from the river. Maybe from above it looks worse, but it&#8217;s hard to tell when your guide is yelling &#8220;Forward Paddle! Forward Paddle!&#8221; and you&#8217;re trying to match your strokes with the guy next to/in front of you.<br />
Suddenly, the powder blue water had turned an angry white. The boat lurched down and a massive wave crashed over the bow, knocking me square in the chest, and into the bottom of the raft. I struggled to get myself back out, but by the time I could, another wave hammered me again. Realizing that there was just no way I could get myself back up on the bow, I stayed inside the boat and hauled my paddle outside and kept paddling.<br />
The boat lurched down and up again, and more ice-cold water briefly blinded me. I flailed with the paddle as best I could, but it was seconds before I could see again. When I did see again, I was quickly wishing I wasn&#8217;t seeing what was about to happen.<br />
Rocks.<br />
Big ones.<br />
Eric, our guide, had either steered us too close to the side of the river (which happened to end in a sheer rock face), or my inability to paddle properly had reduced the power on my side of the boat, steering us in. Can&#8217;t say which, because I honestly don&#8217;t know. Either way, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; we still hit solid rock.<br />
Well, &#8220;hit&#8221; isn&#8217;t a good verb. &#8220;Ran aground&#8221; would be more proper, I guess. The rock was sloped, and what&#8217;s what we ran onto. I could feel the rock beneath me as we ran onto it &#8212; but we didn&#8217;t stay there for long. The river&#8217;s current dragged the raft sideways (with the bow acting as the pivot) and then off the rock and down river.<br />
Right into a large Class V rapid known as &#8220;The Terminator&#8221;.<br />
The raft rolled sharply up on it&#8217;s side (my side being the low side). The sudden upward swing catapulted Sean off the raft. Neil, the old guy at the stern, slid off. I, who was still trying to get back on the side to try and paddle, found the side now slipping out from under me. I, too, fell into the icy Kicking Horse River.<br />
We had been told at the safety orientation that when faced with a large rapid that the guide would yell &#8220;hold on&#8221; and we would grab a rope called the &#8220;centre line&#8221; that ran down the length of the raft. However, the call never came, and I didn&#8217;t see the rapid before it was too late. We&#8217;d also been told that in the event that you couldn&#8217;t grab the centre line, there was another rope that ran around the outside of the raft. This was called (and please pardon the language) the &#8220;Oh Shit!&#8221; line, so named because that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re usually yelling as you fall off.<br />
Luckily, my three years in sailing school had ingrained in me a survival instinct to stay with the boat. After my foot slipped out from under the centre line (I had tried to hike myself back in using that method), I reached for the OS line. Brett was immediately at the side of the raft to help me back in. As we were instructed during our training, I brought my paddle hand out of the water to hand them my paddle &#8230; only it wasn&#8217;t there. In the rush of falling out, I somehow had let go of it. Admittedly, it wasn&#8217;t the first thing on my mind at the time.<br />
Brett hauled me back in on the count of three, and we tried to resume a somewhat stable position. My immediate thought was &#8220;Where the heck is Sean?&#8221; &#8212; he wasn&#8217;t there (I didn&#8217;t know at the time that he&#8217;d been thrown clear off). I looked behind us and saw Sean floating some 100 metres away near the side of the river (the side with the sheer cliff).<br />
As we would find out later, Sean was trying to save his butt. He had managed to hang onto his paddle longer than me, but had turfed it in favour of saving himself. The raft behind us had tried to save him with one of the oars, but just as Sean reached for it, a rapid sucked him under. When he came back up, the raft was too far away, and he wasn&#8217;t getting any warmer. Sean saw a tree near the side, and swam for safety.<br />
Unfortunately, this meant that Sean was trapped at the side of a frigid raging river with no obvious way out. He&#8217;d also lost one of his neoprene boots in the chaos. (But he still had his contact lenses and his waterproof camera.) One of the rafts pulled to the same side of the river as Sean, and the guide went back to retrieve our fallen comrade-in-paddles. It was nearly 30 minutes before we saw them in the trees &#8212; we greeted Sean&#8217;s safe return with loud cat calls.<br />
A few minutes later, Sean was returned to our raft. Two paddles were passed forward, and we continued our trip. Sean and I stuck to the bow, unafraid of what would befall us (having already been befallen) and kept taking the waves. About 20 minutes later, we arrived at the end of our trip.<br />
Half of the group was continuing onto the Lower Kicking Horse, but had to leave the river and drive a bit further down. There&#8217;s a stretch between the Upper Kicking Horse and the Lower Kicking Horse that Eric described as &#8220;impassable&#8221;. He didn&#8217;t elaborate.<br />
Eric was called away to guide one of the Lower rafts, so bade us farewell, and darted away. We were left to peel our waterlogged clothes off, and put our dry clothes (which came in the bus) back on.<br />
We would find out that our raft wasn&#8217;t the only one to be taken out by the Terminator. Two other rafts from another company (which had entered the slot not long before us) had flipped. We got off lucky. Eric must have seen the spectacle, and opted not to tell us so that it wouldn&#8217;t get us worried. Luckily, we&#8217;d gone through a flip drill (not actual, but talked through it) in the event that happened.<br />
We changed, put all our wet things into huge piles, and boarded a bus to take us back to Whitewater Ranch. There we got back into our cars and made for the trip home. I had hoped to convince everyone to stop in Banff and go to the Irish pub there for dinner. I didn&#8217;t seem to get any initial takers, but Sean and Robin said they&#8217;d want to stop somewhere. The consensus was to drive back, and we&#8217;d stop somewhere along the way.<br />
Robin and Sean took the lead, and promptly started to disappear. I don&#8217;t know what their hurry was, but the rest of us had a heck of a time trying to keep up. I was cursing them for about an hour until I finally said &#8220;the heck with it&#8221;, and pulled ahead from Sara and Brett, hoping that they might be able to catch up later. Someone had to tell the other two to slow down.<br />
A couple of times I came close, but as soon as I got within honking distance, they pulled ahead and I couldn&#8217;t catch up. It wasn&#8217;t until we got back to a four-lane divided highway that I managed to catch them. Doing 150 km/h. In a 90 km/h zone. (If I&#8217;m *really* lucky, I won&#8217;t get a speeding ticket.)<br />
I chewed them out over the phone about 30 minutes later, after the cell phone signal was restored. Brett and Sara were nowhere in sight. I finally convinced Robin and Sean to pull over and wait. No sooner than we pulled over than Sara and Brett shot by at about 130 km/h. By the time we got back on the road, they were gone. We assume they pulled into Banff.<br />
We did not &#8212; I gave up my Irish stew and Guinness for a Wendy&#8217;s double hamburger and lemonade. Not exactly what I would call a consolation prize &#8230; more like a booby prize.<br />
When all&#8217;s said and done, it was a lot of fun. And I&#8217;d do it again. I just have to find seven half-suicidal people to go with me&#8230;</p>
