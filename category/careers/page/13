	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not quite five and a half years ago, [[Moving into Critical Mass&#8217; New Building|Critical Mass moved into our current building]]. It was a monumental exercise that required a lot of forethought, planning, and organization. When we moved into the then-new building, we separated into our departments: Project Management (along with Reporting and some account services) on the first floor, Technology (and internal support) on the second floor, Creative on the third floor, with Administration (and some executives) on the fourth floor. Dewi and the Bistro were in the basement.<br />
That&#8217;s pretty much how it was from the moment we got in the building. We&#8217;ve moved around a bit within the floors (I changed seats three times, landing in the same desk space twice), but generally kept the department separation.<br />
That was until a couple of weeks ago, when the Leadership Team (which, apparently, I&#8217;m loosely attached to now) called a meeting to announce the next great move. My first thought was that we were going to move buildings again. We know we&#8217;re running low on available space in this building. We need more people all the time, and are running out of places to put them. Sooner or later, we&#8217;re going to have to lay siege to one of the surrounding buildings and take the space for our own. Personally, I&#8217;m all for buying up the self storage building on the next block and installing a connecting walkway.<br />
But this wasn&#8217;t about running out of space. Well, not directly, anyway. This was Phase 1 of making more effective use of our space. And the first step was to do something that many of us veterans have talked about for years: reorganizing the floors so the project teams sit together. I was a little surprised to hear this, as I honestly thought that the idea had been so thoroughly squashed as to not even render a single drop of whine. We were outlined the almost laughably short timeline under which it would take place, and that no-one would officially know until the week before it took place.<br />
(The irony was that most people already knew &#8212; even before I was told, so I gather. It was one rumour I hadn&#8217;t heard before hearing official notice.)<br />
The trickiest part was that we had to sort out the seating plans so administration could rearrange phones and network connections. (The sad part is most people around here seem to only grudgingly acknowledge the Herculean tasks that Administration regularly pulls off without anyone noticing.) &#8220;Tricky&#8221; because most people had their own thoughts of where they wanted to sit. The task of setting the seating plan, however, would be left to the team leads, to minimize the inevitable cacophony over who was sitting where.<br />
Originally, my business unit was to stay on the second floor. Fine for me, as I&#8217;ve been there for years. Creative, however, wasn&#8217;t so keen on that. As a result of discussions with Misch and Jason, we figured out a plan that would work &#8230; and would give me one of the choicest seats on the floor. (I can rationalize nearly anything. Especially when I can get something good out of it.)<br />
Lest you think I purposely positioned myself to get the best seat, here&#8217;s the reality: I wanted to merge our team members, putting PM next to developer next to designer. In my oh-so-educated [insert sarcasm here] view, it was the best way to try and get projects running, by letting people learn from each other across disciplines and departments. That&#8217;s what I wanted &#8230; but I knew it was going to be a hard sell. Mostly because I&#8217;m the only one who wanted it. So we grouped by department, and the most convenient grouping happened to put the Technology group into the southwest corner. Looking at the desk plan, it just made sense to put me in the corner.<br />
Then we had a business unit rearrangement. Dell&#8217;s been getting bigger and bigger, and finally (like Mercedes-Benz and Rolex before it) be ejected into its own business unit. But it wasn&#8217;t just as simple as moving an account. It meant people had to be moved to handle the movement of the other accounts. It meant the Rolex team had to move &#8212; we were bumped to the third floor. And we had to make a very quick replanning to handle the team&#8217;s movement up one floor. As it stands, we more-or-less moved straight up one floor. And due to fortunate happenstance, I managed to snag the corner desk again. Two windows. Goregous view (compared to what I used to have, anyway). And way too much space.<br />
When we left on Friday, everything packed up and labelled, I questioned whether or not this move would go truly smoothly. My key concern was for things like the side tables. They&#8217;re hot property around the office, and as soon as one becomes available it&#8217;s snapped up. Sure enough, when I arrived on Monday, it was clear that monkey business had ensued in the hours before I arrived. I have no idea exactly what happened, but I sure heard about it.<br />
The other thing I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to hear about is the extra space I&#8217;ve ended up with. There&#8217;s a good desk&#8217;s worth of space between my desk and Jim and Scott&#8217;s. Someone&#8217;s gonna complain about that, I know. Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t mind having someone else in there. It&#8217;s too open. I just don&#8217;t know who would want that space. Frankly, I&#8217;m amazed Jason let me have it. He claimed it was a concession for us having to come to the third floor. Like moving into the best floor of the building is a concession into itself.<br />
Overall, the move is a good thing (irrespective of my desk location). I think it&#8217;ll help the teams work better, even if it means departments suffer a bit as a result. But since our end product is work for our clients, not for ourselves, I think it&#8217;ll go to help the movement. But like many things, only time will tell.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I remember a young whipper-snapper starting at Critical Mass nigh-six years ago. Another newbie, Angie, had mentioned that she&#8217;d brought his stuff out from Winnepeg. Not that I was far off from being a newbie myself &#8212; it had only been a couple of months since I had started.<br />
Since then, Dennis grew from being a quiet little kid to being the single strongest Senior Web Developer we have &#8230; or probably ever had. Dennis and I sat across from each other when we moved to the new building over five years ago. For a year or so, we would chat with each other over ICQ, rarely actually saying anything to one another. We&#8217;d work late almost every night. And we&#8217;d engage in endless debates about technology and management.<br />
Dennis could always code me under the table. He was a better developer, no two ways about it. He scared me back then. I had mastered the ins and outs of developing for Netscape 4 &#8212; a true pain in the arse to support. And the browser equivalent of the evolutionary dead end. Dennis was already well into DOM-compliant development, and object-oriented constructs. He could code a regular expression in his head &#8212; something I can barely do in a regular expression-capable application reading a dummy&#8217;s guide. Despite his age (he was the youngest person at Critical Mass for about three years running), he developed as fast (or faster) than anyone else and kept his own.<br />
A lot of people around here had the impression that I hated Dennis. I have to admit, I have no idea where that came from. Sure, Dennis did pick me off with an eraser once while I was on the phone, but I was just pissed off that someone had done that while I was on the phone! How did they know it wasn&#8217;t a client? In reality, I had &#8212; and still have &#8212; nothing but the highest respect for Dennis. He ran a team easily twice the size of the one I had with seeming ease, and kept everyone running smoothly. Dennis gets higher praise from his team under pressure than I did managing a team under considerably less strain.<br />
I&#8217;m going to miss that devious smirk of his. You&#8217;ll know it when you see it. Dennis is outspoken when he has a particular point of view. He&#8217;s mostly patient, but when he wants to say something, you&#8217;ll see it. He tries not to immediately jump in, but will eventually force his way in. And he doesn&#8217;t come unprepared.<br />
Tabs vs. Spaces. The single largest and most religious of the debates in programming. Which do you use when writing code? The Senior group finally had it out over a month ago. I brought beer to ease the inevitable pain. There wasn&#8217;t nearly as much yelling as I expected. Dennis had his argument for tabs nailed down. I figured he was going to win even before we started &#8212; he&#8217;d prepared himself for <em>months</em>.<br />
Last Friday was Dennis&#8217; &#8220;going away&#8221; binge. A lot of us went to the Ship (and Anchor) to commiserate with our loss. A few of us got into a heated &#8230; no, actually, just drunkenly loud discussion about the past, present, and future of Critical Mass. Those of us who&#8217;ve been around long enough to see the changes (for better or for worse), and speculate on what will be. I do know this much &#8212; you can&#8217;t go home. You can&#8217;t go back to the way things used to be. Times change, and you have to accept that the people you&#8217;ve known and the friends you&#8217;ve made will eventually go the route they need to, even if it is away from yourself.<br />
Dennis was the #3 guy for Web Dev seniority. Now the #3 falls to Torin, who&#8217;s a year and a half behind me. That gap scares me a little bit. That&#8217;s a long gap between seniority. Mind you, we did have some questionable folks in that gap, and there&#8217;s been a long time for them to filter out. But still, it&#8217;s a little worrisome. Mostly because then the next question is: have I overstayed my welcome? It is not a case of there being a gap &#8230; but me staying too long in one place?<br />
D-Money is gone, off to (assumedly) greener pastures. I&#8217;m gonna miss him, too. I miss a lot of people it seems, and a lot more often than I&#8217;d like to. I&#8217;ve written too many entries on people leaving. Inevitable or not for our industry, I still don&#8217;t like when it happens.<br />
Take care, Dennis &#8212; keep shaking things up!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>James on Monday. Rudy on Friday. I can&#8217;t make any &#8220;Rudy Tuesday&#8221; jokes on this one, I&#8217;m afraid.<br />
Rudy was only the second Web Developer that we hired after moving into our current building (I can&#8217;t say &#8220;new&#8221; building, &#8216;cuz it ain&#8217;t new anymore). And that was almost a year after we picked up Carl.<br />
Rudy was one of our workhorses. Give him a task, and let him loose. Didn&#8217;t matter how much time he needed to put into it, didn&#8217;t matter what the estimate was. He got it done, and it was done when it was promised. A quality that is not only admirable, but hard to come across. And it no doubt hurt Rudy&#8217;s social life, at least to some degree.<br />
I never once heard Rudy complain over the years. Admittedly, I&#8217;m not sure complaining is even in Rudy&#8217;s nature. A couple of years ago, Rudy was in a fairly nasty motorbike accident, basically screwing up his legs for a month or two. But even when he struggled in for Jude&#8217;s farewell (see [[So long, Jude!]]) on crutches, he was still all smiles and laughs. I suppose that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to miss most about Rudy.<br />
Rudy was one of the popular crowd, something I never was. Never been a popular person in general, really. I&#8217;m Joe Average. I have my ups and down, but when it comes to the end of the day, I don&#8217;t stand out, make waves, attract, or repel. In a group of two, I&#8217;m the one you won&#8217;t see. I wasn&#8217;t part of the 5% &#8212; even if I was included in a couple of events &#8212; and generally only find out about things after they happen.<br />
That sort of thing really used to bother me a lot, being left out. I was never sure of it was a conscious thing: &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t call Geoff &#8212; we don&#8217;t want him around here!&#8221;. Or was it just merely that I&#8217;m forgotten? Hard to say which is worse &#8212; exclusion or insignificance. They both pretty nasty. It&#8217;s also hard on the ego, being left out like that. It really makes you think about the friends that you have (or don&#8217;t have), and how people ultimately view you.<br />
I&#8217;ve come to accept that I&#8217;m generally not liked. (Hopefully, it doesn&#8217;t extend to me being outright hated.) At best, I&#8217;m tolerated. I can&#8217;t trace the thousand steps it took me to get where I am. It&#8217;s those thousand steps &#8212; or thousand cuts? &#8212; that slowly wore away at any appeal that I did have (and probably some of the credibility, too). I might get the job done, but generally I&#8217;m just a bastard. An ass. Maybe it&#8217;s my own self-importance speaking to me, I&#8217;m not sure. But I know that people treat me differently now than they used to even a couple of years ago. And I feel alone.<br />
With Rudy&#8217;s departure, isolation sinks in more and more.<br />
Rudy was supposed to be my major project this year. Despite being at Critical Mass about three and a half years, he never made it to Senior. I felt he was ready, just that we needed to push him a little more. It was all minor stuff, too. And that the opportunity we had planned for him on the Michelin projects didn&#8217;t come through the way we&#8217;d planned. In many ways, I feel like I failed him.<br />
There&#8217;s almost none of the old guard left. After Dennis, it&#8217;s about a year and a half before you get to Torin, the next most senior web developer we have. I talk to those who&#8217;ve gone to &#8220;greener pastures&#8221;, and I wonder what it would be like out there. In a little over two weeks, I complete my sixth year here at Critical Mass. I&#8217;ve come a long way &#8230; but at what cost? Maybe I&#8217;ve become too complacent? Have I been responsible for too many people leaving? Am I even competant in my job anymore?<br />
I ask myself questions like this more and more. I do what I think is right, but is it? Maybe Rudy&#8217;s got the right idea &#8212; get out while you can and do something else. Work someplace different. Reground yourself before it&#8217;s too late. And maybe I am where I&#8217;m supposed to be. Maybe I&#8217;m already in the only place I can be. Oh, the questions&#8230;<br />
Good luck, Rudy. We&#8217;re gonna miss you &#8217;round the farm. Wherever you land, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be good.</p>

		<p>Another one bites the dust.<br />
I hate it when friends leave, even if it&#8217;s just to go to another company in the city. And with James&#8217; departure, it hits a little more. Not just because I saw a lot of my older self in him, not just because he was one of our Sr. developers, or even just because he single-handedly put an end to reply-alls in the building for a long time.<br />
It&#8217;s probably because this place will be a lot quieter without him.<br />
I still remember when James started. He was a young, brash, loud, and potentially brilliant developer. Which meant that certain people on the team immediately hated him. Why? Because James rocked the boat by refusing to fall in line. Unlike those of us who chose to go against doctrine in a more passive manner, James was much more vocal. Where others use subtlety, James used subterfuge. When others whispered, James cracked a whip.<br />
Very early on, James single-handedly took on the issue of people replying to companywide emails with trivial points, often engaging everyone in a conversation that no-one truly cared about. James&#8217; approach? The most effective weapon in his arsenal: comedic, sometimes outright mocking images. They did an exceedingly good job at putting replies to an end. James&#8217; first image was beautifully simple: a small boy, praying at the side of a bed (presumably before he went to sleep). The caption read: &#8220;Please God, make it stop.&#8221;<br />
James&#8217; second reply was to a CEO&#8217;s email. I suggested that he might want to back off until he at least passed his probationary period.<br />
I saw a lot of myself in James, only amplified a few times. The brashness of youth, the self-realization of brillance, the demands of excellence. James has yet to reach the age I was when I started (though he is close now), and I wonder if he will mellow over the years in the way I have calmed down. (Those of you who knew me as a teenager/early 20-something will no doubt find that hard to believe.)<br />
I had hoped we could hang onto James, but after three-ish years it&#8217;s hard to hang onto veterans. That&#8217;s the nature of our industry &#8212; a couple years here, a couple years there, and the process goes on. The loss of experience and knowledge is often hard to deal with. It hurts every time we lose a long-term employee. We&#8217;ve seen this loss many times over, and we&#8217;ll see it again and again &#8212; the nature of our business.<br />
Amy. Luke. Adam. Mark. Dave. Jaime. Christine. Andrew. Jude. Scott. Angie. Pat. Carl. Rich. Vlad. Neil. Tamara. Bill. Myles. Damon. Ed. Cory. Jules. Reid. Darren. Nancy. Rob. Jen. Graham. Dave (a different one). And that&#8217;sonly just those I can easily remember. I missed recording most of the departures over the last year due to my blogging inactivity. (There&#8217;s a thousand reasons for that, none of which have any real validity when it comes down to the fact that I just didn&#8217;t do what I should have been doing.) So for all of you who have left who wonder where your farewell is &#8230; I can only apologize.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m not blaming anyone for this. Ours is a hard industry, and it&#8217;s hard to stay here for long without the desire to move on. That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that the pressures of the job don&#8217;t get to you first. Client demands are often a hard thing, and they can wear you down. Even in the lower echelons, where client contact rarely happens, the trickle-down effect can be quite pronounced.<br />
I suppose after a while you become immune to the pressure. Or you find a way of dealing with it. Or you go insane. Heck, there&#8217;s really only four options, and if you don&#8217;t decide to move on, you succumb to each of the other three over time &#8230; though the order in which each of them gets you is different from person to person. I think I&#8217;ve almost reached the &#8220;immune&#8221; stage. Or at least, I hope I&#8217;ve almost reached it.<br />
So James is gone. Unlike Scott or Jude, though, he&#8217;s still in town. So it&#8217;s not so bad. And Mike has returned after his effective exile of about four years ago. Rudy&#8217;s going soon, so that&#8217;s something else to contend with.<br />
Times they are a changin&#8217;. For better or for worse, that&#8217;s how life goes. It sucks when friends aren&#8217;t as readily accessible as they were before, but at least &#8212; if nothing else &#8212; the internet does make communication significantly easier.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Critical Mass works hard. We know that from all the various nervous ticks we&#8217;ve developed over the years from working too hard.<br />
So you can imagine that when we play, we make up for the difference.<br />
There are two annual events in the Critical Mass calendar. The first is the Summer Event, which has been a staple since I started back in 2000. The other, a more recent edition, is the CMMYs (pronounced &#8220;see-emmies&#8221;). It&#8217;s our own internal awards show, showcasing the work we&#8217;ve done over the last year. It&#8217;s a combination of the Emmys, the Oscars, the MTV Movie Awards, and a car crash. Namely, that it runs longer than you think, but you just can&#8217;t stop watching it.<br />
During CMMY week, Critical Mass is a madhouse. Mostly because we import all of our offices to Calgary and still try to function. The Calgary office surprisingly can still accomodate all those people &#8212; well over 300 of them &#8212; and not have to share desks. Meeting rooms, on the other hand, are in much shorter supply. And that&#8217;s a problem when meetings become a priority because everyone&#8217;s here. And because it&#8217;s a prime time for 2006 planning.<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;m glad that this week is nearly over &#8212; the meetings have been murder, and I&#8217;ve not gotten nearly enough done. Next week, things will return to normal. I hope.<br />
The events of this week have been varied, but interesting. People started arriving Monday morning from the Toronto office &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t expecting people until Tuesday at the earliest. The Bistro was quite full at breakfast. Faces I&#8217;d not seen in quite some time (partly due to me leaving the Mercedes-Benz account) were a happy sight. And a lot of faces that I&#8217;ve never seen before.<br />
I used to pride myself on knowing everyone in the company. But there are just too many of them now. I think I&#8217;ll be lucky to know even half of Critical Mass. Half of that number I might know personally. It might be a small world, but there are lot of people in it.<br />
Tuesday was the Town Hall and Department meetings. The winter Town Hall is often &#8230; well, dull. Not because it&#8217;s all financial and organizational material. Not <em>just</em> because. It&#8217;s mostly because it&#8217;s not played up as much as the summer Town Hall, which has been the source of some absolute hilarity at the complete expense of anything business-related. So the winter session is a little harder to sit through.<br />
The Department meeting was also a little hard to sit through, despite the lubrication of having beer readily available. The major issue was how the Technology department will work at Critical Mass. We&#8217;ve reorganized a bit, and we&#8217;re now part of the Strategy group. This, I like. I like the idea that Planning will come before Design, and that Technology is a part of that planning. The trouble is, that&#8217;s not the way that Critical Mass has worked in the past &#8212; Technology has historically come after the Design phase.<br />
It&#8217;s not that we&#8217;re objected to change, only that we don&#8217;t understand yet how it will all work. But that&#8217;s the thing &#8212; no-one has spelled it out in detail. And no-one will &#8212; you can&#8217;t, there&#8217;s just too many things to state to make it an effective piece of communication. But it&#8217;s the direction that matters, and it&#8217;s something we need to pay closer attention to. Agility and strategic positioning is what it&#8217;s all about.<br />
Wednesday was all about meetings of various kinds. Two of particular importance to me, however, were the Web Development meetings. First was a meeting of the Senior web developers. This is the steering group, the ones who set the best practices in the company, and guide the rest of the team in our daily work. For the last few weeks, we&#8217;ve been establishing our own internal standards. We&#8217;ve had the standards embedded in our culture for a long time, but never actually written down. Now that we have more than one production office, we need to get our act together.<br />
The topic of this meeting? It was important to have this specific meeting, given that all of our seniors were in the same place (except Colin, who got sucked away to a client visit in California). This was the sort of discussion that required everyone present. It&#8217;s a religious debate amongst developers, one that widely divides camps, and creates shouting matches. (Which is also why I bought beer, so we could keep it somewhat calm.)<br />
Tabs vs. spaces.<br />
For those of you in the programming field, you know what I mean. For those of you who have no idea what the big deal is, well, it&#8217;s hard to explain the passion that abounded about which standard we would use. Personally, I didn&#8217;t care. Or I didn&#8217;t until that meeting. As the arguments went along, I fell into line with Dennis&#8217; well-crafted argument to use tabs. Torin&#8217;s defence of spaces never really quite caught on for me, though it was also well-handled. Tabs won out.<br />
The next meeting was not as successful as I would have liked: the Web Dev Bru Ha Ha. Every so often, we try to get the entire Web Dev team out for a drink after work. It&#8217;s a chance to mingle and get to know one another. But despite having the entire team in the city, we got barely half of the team out. Sadly, or fortunately (depending on your view), it just means we&#8217;ll have to keep trying until we get it right.<br />
Thursday, yesterday, was the big day. Everyone was anticipating the big night. And we knew from the start that this was going to be something interesting, when spying the Brokeback Mountain poster taped to one of the meeting room walls &#8230; and then realizing that it said &#8220;Brettback Evan&#8221; and featured the faces of two of our IT wizards, Brett and Evan in place of Heath and Jake.<br />
One final meeting was the BU meeting &#8212; the Business Unit that we belong to. Our BUs are colour-coded, and contain one or more accounts depending on their size. Until a week or so ago, I was part of the Orange BU. That was until we found out that our newest client &#8212; for whom I&#8217;m the Technology Director &#8212; was a lot larger than we&#8217;d thought. Now I&#8217;m in the Gold BU. We&#8217;re still small, but we&#8217;ll be growing this year. But due to our compact size, we could easily squeeze into the upper floor of the Rose and Crown. We were back at the office just before 17:00 to get ready for the CMMYs.<br />
The CMMYs are a time for Critical Mass to play it up a bit. It&#8217;s also a time for us to look more presentable than usual. In fact, there&#8217;s even a dress code: No jeans, no running shoes, no hats. That&#8217;s it, so it leaves a lot of options open &#8212; no matter what your sense of taste is. Last year, it brought out guys in the stereotypically gaudy 1970&#8217;s powder blue tuxedos complete with the ruffled shirts. It&#8217;s a chance for Jerry, our Chairman, to break out his very dapper tuxedo. It&#8217;s a chance for people to dress up in ways they normally wouldn&#8217;t, and enjoy the change.<br />
Deciding that I&#8217;ve worn my wedding suit too often (it&#8217;s becoming a pattern), I opted for something a little different. I wore my kilt.<br />
Actually, it was my dad&#8217;s kilt. Custom-made in Scotland. It&#8217;s a heavy little bugger, but it looks great. The last time I&#8217;d worn it was at Cathy&#8217;s wedding. Back then, I didn&#8217;t like the kilt so much. It&#8217;s a winter-weight kilt, which means you bake in the middle of the summer. I was also a few pounds heavier, meaning I barely fit in it.<br />
I&#8217;m thinner now (thanks to Arthur), so wearing it isn&#8217;t such a burden. And being winter, it&#8217;s more comfortable. Well, almost. It figures that the first actual cold day since winter began in Calgary is the day I&#8217;m going to not wear pants. It was -35 with the wind chill.<br />
We all arrived at the Calgary Hyatt for 18:00 &#8212; the start of cocktail time. When Neil spotted me walking into the coat check area, he spied my hairy legs poking out from under my Morrison dress tartan, and immediately declared: &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna know.&#8221;<br />
He was referring, of course, to the oft-mentioned fact: what do Scotsmen wear beneath the kilt? You&#8217;d be surprised how often I was asked that question. But only one person dared check: John. The sheep-shagging haggis stuffer was the only one bold enough to continue hauling it up. I don&#8217;t think he ever got a good look, thankfully! John and I have a long history, though &#8212; he was my account manager on my first project. I met him for the first time when I&#8217;d had to be sent down to Cincinnati to fix a problem on another project (see [[Live from Cincinnati]]).<br />
Dinner was served promptly at 19:00 &#8230; I think. I&#8217;d officially lost track of time by then. I was at the back of the room with my fellow technical cohorts, most of them Flash developers. The rest were web developers. I felt like the old fart at the table, and not just the fact that I&#8217;m older than the rest of them. I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass nearly six years &#8212; only Natalia came close to my tenure. I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass long enough to be able to remember the events coming up on the projection screen.<br />
(Incidentally, to the Critical Mass historian: the first town hall that took place at the Danish Community Centre followed by a visit to Ceili&#8217;s took place in 2000, not 1999 as it appeared. I know &#8212; I was there. I have witnesses to that effect.)<br />
Dinner was surprisingly good. I was worried that our meals would be &#8230; not terribly satisfying due to the banquet-style serving. But the Hyatt did an outstanding job of my steak. Certainly something worth praising, I think.<br />
Following dinner, we began the awards show. Every year, we strive to have someone worthy of being on stage, someone who can captivate the audience, while simultaneously being able to offer witty, sometimes slanderous quips. Who else but the beautiful Arif?<br />
The awards go for most risky project, ones with the most changes before it was complete, best integration, and so forth. Mixed in between the awards were short clips of video promoting our CMVPs, one of whom would be chosen as CMVP of the year. It&#8217;s a big honour &#8230; and a big cheque. I&#8217;d filmed some stuff for Torin&#8217;s segment. The best part was seeing how the video was edited into it&#8217;s final form. Quotes were intentionally taken out of reference, things spliced in such a way as to tell a story that no one person could tell.<br />
Also thrown in were two other special events. The first was a tribute to Jerry, our new Chairman of the Board. Jerry used to be the CEO, but we had a restructuring this year that put Jerry to the head of the heap. I&#8217;ve gotten to know Jerry a bit over the years, though I know most of my knowledge is courtesy of stories told by others. Though Jerry does tell a number of good ones, himself.<br />
The second was a tribute to employee #001. It was introduced by Darren, who believed himself to be #001. As the story goes, though, he found out that he wasn&#8217;t in fact #001. So he renumbered himself to #000. The one bearing #001 is Randy &#8212; our first financial wizard. Randy doesn&#8217;t say much, but he certainly did this time. And Randy didn&#8217;t allow himself to stay alone, asking up the other original few who are still with Critical Mass. It was time to celebrate one more thing:<br />
iPods.<br />
No, wait, sorry &#8212; that was afterwards. It was to celebrate 10 Years of Critical Mass. Ten years ago, Ted Hellard and Michel Clairo started a little CD-ROM firm. Today, we&#8217;re the top interactive agency in North America. A few people working out of a living room turned into a seven-office marketing demon with over 300 employees. I&#8217;ve been here over half of its life, and I think I&#8217;m going to be here for a long time to come &#8230; I hope.<br />
As a present to everyone who had helped Critical Mass get to where we are, everyone was given a gift: iPods. 30GB versions to the permanent employees, Shuffles to the term employees. I&#8217;ve already got a Nano, so this was icing on the cake. On the back is an inscription: &#8220;CRITICAL MASS Ten years and counting&#8221;.<br />
Brett won for CMVP of the year &#8212; deservedly so. The presentation was accompanied by the trailer for Brettback Evan, a parody of Brokeback Mountain. Every year, every meeting like this, someone creates a classic Critical Mass video. This was the CMMYs&#8217; contribution to posterity. It joins the class of &#8220;Arif Striptease&#8221;, &#8220;Dirty J&#8221;, &#8220;Luke&#8217;s Workout&#8221;, and &#8220;The Office Enforcer&#8221;. One day, I&#8217;ll need to get a DVD of all of these.<br />
We never all made it to Ducky&#8217;s. That had been the plan. But in typical awards fashion, we didn&#8217;t wrap up the show until nearly midnight. By then, it was clear we were better off staying at the Hyatt. I held out until about 2:00 before finally weaving my way home. I&#8217;m not able to handle the drive as well as I used to &#8212; I must be getting old.<br />
This morning was a little rough. My head hurt. Tylenol, an extra-cheesy omelette, a -25 degree walk to the bus stop to get to work (I left my car at the office so I wouldn&#8217;t drive home), and four mugs of jasmine tea corrected the queasiness.<br />
My throat hurts, and my voice is a good octave lower. That&#8217;s mostly due to yelling. As anyone who&#8217;s been around me after two beers and in a noisy environment knows, my ability to control the volume of my voice goes right out the window. I&#8217;m sure I deafened Ryan when I was encouraging him to be passionate about something he wants to do.<br />
Gary showed up at work in the same clothes as last night. He doesn&#8217;t fully remember everything. He wasn&#8217;t even sure if he took pictures (he did) or what happened to his jacket. People are calling in sick. Those here aren&#8217;t moving with the same vigour as usual. Pictures from last night look &#8230; interesting.<br />
God, I love this company.<br />

		<p>Some companies, those that want to be &#8220;fun&#8221; companies, sometimes give their staff things like shirts, bags, water jugs, and various other bits of paraphernalia emblazoned with the company logo.<br />
A couple of years ago, Critical Mass gave us sling bags, in either blue or yellow, with the Critical Mass logo on the back. Some people thought they were kinda dorky. Me? I&#8217;m loving this thing!<br />
<a href=""><br />
<img width="300" alt="Critical Mass on the Great Wall of China" src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03633.JPG" /><br />
</a><br />
I don&#8217;t know who specifically chose this bag style, but I&#8217;ll assume it was someone like Cyndy. This bag has been lugged most of the way around the world now, acting as my day pack. It&#8217;s been on the Great Wall. It&#8217;s been through the Hermitage. It&#8217;s seen the deserts of Mongolia. And it&#8217;s been rained on a couple of times (including a nice, semi-tropical downpour) and kept my stuff dry!<br />
So far, the only problem has been the stitching falling apart on the Velcro for the side flap. Nothing 30 minutes with a sewing kit can&#8217;t fix.<br />
Did I mention that I love this bag?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Five years ago, I walked in the doors of Critical Mass, having basically no idea what I was about to get myself into.<br />
At the time, I wasn&#8217;t planning on being at Critical Mass that long. Chris and I had planned on going to Japan to teach English. (Only Chris ever made it there.) Somehow, I thought I&#8217;d stick around.<br />
Until this job, I&#8217;d never thought I&#8217;d be at a company for more than two years. The longest job I&#8217;d been at was two years and one month, and that seemed like a long time.<br />
Yesterday marked the end of my fifth year here, and today the beginning of my sixth. I don&#8217;t see any immediate end to my career here, and only an interesting future ahead of me.<br />
Why am I still here after all this time? Why haven&#8217;t I moved on to greener pastures? One primary reason: there aren&#8217;t many pastures greener than here, and in Calgary, those pastures are exceedingly rare. There&#8217;s a lot of opportunity for me at Critical Mass, and I find that I&#8217;d be hard-pressed to do better elsewhere.<br />
Besides, as something many people have noted over the years, it&#8217;s the people. The people who work here are what makes Critical Mass such a great place to work. I don&#8217;t have mere co-workers, I have friends. They&#8217;re not just colleagues, they&#8217;re partners-in-crime.<br />
What can I say? The last five years have been a lot of fun. I&#8217;m curious to see what the next five years hold.</p>

		<p>For the last two nights, Critical Mass has run what are effectively recruiting job fairs over at the Roundup Centre.<br />
They&#8217;re weird things. We&#8217;d done them before when we were recruiting for a planned move to Toronto (which sadly didn&#8217;t come to fruition, only because the potential client ended up staying with their incumbent agency). I didn&#8217;t do the Toronto sessions, but I&#8217;d heard they were both a great success and utter mayhem.<br />

		<p>Yesterday was tough. We did a lot of talking. We didn&#8217;t leave the building until we were done. The three of us, Lark, and Jim went for dinner at some steak house. Despite having been out with the client before, I felt oddly nervous. I don&#8217;t know why. Maybe because this was nothing to do with marketing, it&#8217;s all about technology. It&#8217;s weird. And exhausting.<br />
I ate along this morning, as Allard and Mark took their time to get downstairs. We took another car to Mercedes&#8217; New Jersey office and prepared for another day of talking. Most of today would be my thing, namely my current baby, the CSR (Client-Side Rewrite). It&#8217;s a massive overhaul to strip out the legacy crap and put in something more solid to keep things moving.<br />
