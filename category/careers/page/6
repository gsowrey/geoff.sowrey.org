	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Critical Mass is growing. We&#8217;re preparing for a (hoped) massive expansion, but also have organic growth to contend with.<br />
This is what led Critical Mass to have to hire a new Project Analyst. And luckily for me, it&#8217;s my friend Graham.<br />
You might remember Graham from a couple train chases, specifically my last hunt of 6060 (see [[Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley]]) and from the Inaugural Run of the CPR Empress (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]). It&#8217;s because of Graham&#8217;s ex-girlfriend that I met Graham while chasing 2816, because I looked a little lost. Since them, Graham and I have forged an interesting friendship, based mostly around trains.<br />
This means, of course, that I&#8217;m no longer the only train guy in the office. And some people here already know this. When Graham came for his first interview, Claude asked him about his hobbies, which included (of course) chasing trains. They asked if Graham knew me.<br />
Now this is where I got screwed. You see, Graham didn&#8217;t apply for this job because of me. I didn&#8217;t even know about it. Graham applied knowing that I work for Critical Mass. Because he wanted to get in on his own merit, he feined ignorance of me. If I&#8217;d had the chance to recommend him (and I would have), I could have received a $1,000 referral bonus.<br />
*Sigh*<br />
Either way, it&#8217;s all good. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see Graham more than I have in the past (which isn&#8217;t that much), but with him on the fourth floor and me on the second, it&#8217;s hard to say how much our paths will cross.<br />
And we have to be a little cautious. If both of us ever called in sick at once, the immediate assumption would be that we&#8217;re chasing trains.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once in a while, someone notices you. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a pretty woman walking down the street. Sometimes it&#8217;s a friend you haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. And once in a while, it&#8217;s your entire company.<br />
This year, starting in our Town Hall meeting in June, Critical Mass decided to implement a kind of &#8220;employee of the month&#8221; award. It&#8217;s formally called the &#8220;Critical Mass Valuable Person&#8221;, or cMVP for short. The criteria for nomination are pretty straight-forward:<br />
(Taken from the nomination form)</p>
<ul>
<li>Exemplifies our values:</li>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Excellence &amp; Results</li>
<li>Teamwork &amp; Respect</li>
<li>Creativity &amp; Innovation</li>
<li>Leadership &amp; Accountability</li>
<li>Integrity &amp; Honesty</li>
</ul>
<li>Is technically superior in their job</li>
<li>Has a consistent, positive attitude towards clients, fellow project team members, fellow colleagues, their job and Critical Mass</li>
<li>Is reliable and conscientious in everyday tasks and job expectations</li>
<li>Strives to learn continuously on a personal level or by facilitating learning for others</li>
<li>Displays initiative by taking on projects outside of their job description</li>
<li>Shares ideas and contributes to best practices at a project, department or company level</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty high standards, if you ask me. And considering that the timeframe is (ideally) a month, that&#8217;s an awful lot of work to have to pull off for someone to take notice. I also cannot really see myself completely fulfilling some of these criteria. Take &#8220;technically superior&#8221;. It&#8217;s a little subjective. As a Web Developer, I&#8217;ll rate myself as, say, better than average. But technically superior? I can&#8217;t honestly agree to that &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of people here who can code circles around me.<br />
No-one who receives the cMVP knows about it going into the presentation. They&#8217;re just a face in the crowd, like everyone else. Where I was standing, I couldn&#8217;t hear much, aside from snippets of what this person was like. When I heard &#8220;takes pictures of all our events&#8221;, my heart stopped for a moment. I do that. It could be me. But then I dismissed it &#8212; Jude takes lots of pictures, and with everything he does, I&#8217;d expect him long before me.<br />
&#8220;This month&#8217;s cMVP is Geoff Sowrey.&#8221;<br />
I froze. Blood ran cold. Eyes bugged out.<br />
Me??<br />
Stunned. Pure stunned. Nothing more eloquent will ever fully describe the feeling of total shock I felt when I heard my name. I stood in place, people around me staring (and clapping, I think), for what seemed an eternity before I got myself to move. Thelton, our President and COO, the person giving out the award, couldn&#8217;t even see me from where I was standing.<br />
Ever since the cMVP was first announced, I had wished I could qualify for it. But there are a lot of people in this company deserving of such an award. They put in a lot of effort, sometimes for little more than a &#8220;thank you&#8221;. While my wildest dreams had me winning cMVP, my reality was quite content to nominate others and not worry about it.<br />
Winning the cMVP is like an Emmy or an Oscar. You&#8217;re nominated by your peers, although it&#8217;s the Executive who selects you. It&#8217;s the second-highest award you can win here. (The highest is the cMVP of the Year, which has yet to be given out.) That&#8217;s just fine with me &#8212; I&#8217;ll be flying quite high on this for a while, I think.<br />
So I find myself here, on a Monday that&#8217;s not going nearly as well as I&#8217;d have liked, typing away about something I won (I very much hesitate using the word &#8220;deserved&#8221;) with still-shaking hands. It&#8217;s an honour that I&#8217;ll have to live up to even more than I apparently already do.<br />
I don&#8217;t toot my own horn (at least too often). But I certainly won&#8217;t object to others tooting it for me.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The weekend past was the August long weekend. Well, it was the long weekend for most people. For me, it was one of three things: painting the house, spending time with family, or being at work.<br />
Four things, if you count sleeping.<br />
Mom arrived in town Wednesday afternoon. Her arrival was what had fuelled my desire to paint the house. The idea was to have the whole thing painted in time for her arrival. Yeah, my ambition&#8217;s pretty sizeable. I figure: Go big, or go home. I might have made it, had it not been for a couple of work-related things that came up and threw me off-target for time.<br />
Wednesday night I spent with Mom, Aunt Brenda, and my cousin Jen. Thursday night was here at the office, dealing with project work. For the first time since I started doing overtime at Critical Mass (on my second day on the job &#8212; see [[My First Entry from Critical Mass]]), I wasn&#8217;t programming. I was doing the things I used to do before I came to Critical Mass: document editing and formatting (and a little writing and editing).<br />
What was I working on? We&#8217;re doing the single largest pitch in the history of Critical Mass. And I can&#8217;t tell you who it&#8217;s for, so don&#8217;t ask. All I can tell you is that if we do win it, the contract will fundamentally change Critical Mass. It&#8217;s that big.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Aren&#8217;t I Mercedes-Benz Boy? I&#8217;m still working on our single largest account, no worries about that. But it&#8217;s been a slow year for us, and I had the opportunity to contribute. I also offered to assist with the document construction.<br />
Why did I do that? Well, for those of you who know what I used to do, it&#8217;s probably a bit of a surprise. For those of you who don&#8217;t, allow me to tell you why I&#8217;m a web developer. After graduating university, I became a Technical Writer (something I&#8217;d started doing on co-op work terms). I did technical writing for six years in total. Towards the end, I hated it so much I sometimes felt like a coyote caught in a trap, and wanted to gnaw my own hands off.<br />
While at Radical Entertainment, I started pushing myself more towards web development. I&#8217;d already been doing it for a number of years, so it wasn&#8217;t that big a stretch. Owing to a need to leave Vancouver, I came here. Based on a recommendation from my friend Scott, I applied at Critical Mass and the rest is history. But what isn&#8217;t commonly known is that while I was waiting for word from Critical Mass about my position, I was actively avoiding several technical writing positions.<br />
That&#8217;s how much this pitch means to Critical Mass. That&#8217;s how much I was driven to go back to doing what I used to do. That&#8217;s how I ended up in the office on Thursday night, most of Saturday, and all of Monday (8:00 to well after 22:00).<br />
That&#8217;s how I remembered how much I hate Microsoft Word.<br />
Friday night was the first of what will likely be many family dinners while Mom is out visiting. (Not that I&#8217;m complaining in any way.) But it was Saturday that was the big event &#8212; the birthday party for my Aunt Brenda. I won&#8217;t tell you how old she is, but it&#8217;s the one that causes people to put 50 pink flamingos on your front lawn.<br />
It was supposed to be a surprise party. It was supposed to be a grand little affair where we get her to scream in delight, etc. But I seem the only living person in my family able to organize these things without the guests of honour finding out. Aunt Brenda almost planned her entire party. Were it not for me being a royal pain-the-ass, she would have spent a good portion of it in the kitchen preparing food. I started banning her from the kitchen.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t easy, either. Aunt Brenda&#8217;s kitchen is a magnet for her. Every time I turned my back, she was back in there. I actually uttered: &#8220;Don&#8217;t make me come in there!&#8221;<br />
She did.<br />
I ended up finally kicking her out and handling the things she would have done, like making the best darn corn bread on the planet. It&#8217;s a heart attack in a pan, but it&#8217;s worth the potential coronary. I have *got* to get that recipe one of these days.<br />
The next day, I woke up a little early (for a weekend) to resume painting. It&#8217;s finally cooled off a bit, and it allowed me to tackle painting the front of the house &#8212; the only side I wanted to do before Mom saw the house. (I still have to do the west wall, but you can&#8217;t see it unless you&#8217;re in my neighbour&#8217;s yard.) I even got several of the windows finished up.<br />
Painting a house can be a bit of a Zen thing. (&#8220;Zen and the Art of Decorative Trim&#8221;?) I&#8217;ve had several people tell me that it might be great to have tunes blaring while slapping down a coat of paint. I have yet to have a radio turned on. And when I&#8217;m using the paint sprayer, I can&#8217;t hear anything else.<br />
House painting, in some ways, returns you to your youth. Especially when you use latex paints. It doesn&#8217;t stick to glass, plastic, or skin. It makes you feel like that creepy kid in second grade who put Elmer&#8217;s Glue all over their hands so they could peel it off like a layer of skin. It&#8217;s especially fun in the shower. Doesn&#8217;t matter how dried the paint is &#8212; a little warm water and soap, and *poof* there&#8217;s a clump of sloughed-off paint skin on the shower floor.<br />
Mom, Aunt Brenda, and Jen appeared around 14:00. Mom was being dropped off while the other two checked out &#8220;Johnny English&#8221;. Mom, Tamara and I chatted in the backyard for a while, listening to some jerk across the alley scream his head off at another tenant about unpaid bills and broken windows. It was an argument I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in listening to, but had little choice.<br />
Mom half-guilted me into cleaning up the yard a bit while we sat out back. Mostly cutting back all the suckers growing from two trees and the lilac bush. Admittedly, though, it did look better. Then it was back to painting.<br />
As Sunday was Aunt Brenda&#8217;s actual birthday, we all went out for dinner at a nice homey Italian restaurant along 17th Ave., Buon Giorno. Definitely not the swankiest restaurant in Calgary, but they make a good meal. Try the scallops &#8212; their chef cooks them to absolute perfection.<br />
My cell phone rang at 7:33 Monday morning. It was Chicago. Although I&#8217;d been on call all weekend, this was *the* call I&#8217;d been expecting. I was in the office 10 minutes later and editing. I had hoped to paint that morning. No matter. The worst that would happen was I&#8217;d be editing until 16:00, at which time the documents were off to Kinko&#8217;s for copying.<br />
Or at least that&#8217;s what I thought.<br />
The morning was sheer chaos and panic, especially when I saw the state of the appendix. It would take a phone call with Heather to put my mind at ease, especially when I realized that not everything in the appendix was supposed to be formatted.<br />
More problems with Word trying to do things I didn&#8217;t want it to do. These are problems that Microsoft has never removed. And before you go saying: &#8220;Must be a problem with the user&#8221;, when I first detected them with Word 97, I stumped the tech support guys in Redmond, WA who were unable to solve the problem. You&#8217;d think after six years, they&#8217;d fix the damn thing.<br />
Final call came sometime after 22:00 last night. I was tired. I hadn&#8217;t felt that tired as a result of office work in a very long time. But the pitch is off to the hopeful client-to-be. Now we just have to wait a half a month to find out if they want to take us to the second round or not. I hope there&#8217;s not as much pressure as the first round.<br />
My idea of pressure on the second round is the kind sealed by bottle cap.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are certainly worse ways to spend Friday the 13th. There are certainly more healthy ones. But when Critical Mass decides to throw a party for its employees, you can be sure of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There will be a lot of laughs.</li>
<li>There will be a lot of drunk people. (That kind of leads back to #1.)</li>
</ol>
<p>(I should point out, for the record, that the New Year party was extremely tame. I have no idea why specifically, but it was the first time I haven&#8217;t seen at least a few co-workers completely loaded.)<br />
Unlike last year&#8217;s little surprise (see [[Critical Mass 5th Anniversary Surprise Party]]), the staff knew that this party was coming. What they didn&#8217;t know was where it was going to be. There were many theories: Sylvan Lake, Calaway Park, Banff, even whitewater rafting. Most were discounted due to distance, cost, and safety. One location that had circulated a few times was COP &#8212; Canada Olympic Park. I assumed it would not be there, since I assumed (rather poorly) that there was little for us to do there. Little did I know&#8230;<br />
Our morning began a little earlier than usual. For me, it was with a little more responsibility &#8212; I had to take a staff photo. In the six years that Critical Mass has been in business, there has never been a staff photo. This was the first time since the Kelowna trip (see [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]]) that we&#8217;ve had everyone in the same place at the same time.<br />
Since we laid six people off last week (including my roommate), we are without an &#8220;official&#8221; photographer. I guess I&#8217;m the next in line (can&#8217;t imagine why), so I was asked to take the picture. To allow this, Darrell (the VP of Operations) arranged for me to gain access to the roof of the next door building and shoot across the parking lot. Two great things about this: the angle is perfect, and the sun in the morning is great.<br />
The bad thing? Organizing that many staff is like herding cats. Which is why I was very happy to be just outside of comfortable shouting range.<br />
Pictures in hand, we boarded our busses for our unknown location (which we would soon find out was COP). We were grouped into five teams: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, White. (These are representative of the Olympic colours, of course.) This not only organizes us, but creates the groundwork for the competitive in-your-face attitudes that we generally lack in the office.<br />
Okay, it&#8217;s a chance for us to completely mock each other.<br />
The line at the bar formed as soon as the busses arrived. It took less than a few minutes for us to be kicking back in the main tent, drinking our beverage of choice (usually one of Corona or Heineken), and getting into the groove of the day. Pat and I both remarked that in some ways, the day was reminicent of the Kelowna trip &#8212; starting the day off with beer.<br />
What I would find was that as the day went on, the more I felt like I was not in Calgary. The company had whisked us away to parts unknown to engage in a weekend of total debauchery. It wasn&#8217;t to the same scale as Kelowna (I&#8217;ll be very impressed if we ever see that again), but there was so much energy from having the entire day to do (pretty much) as we pleased that everyone seemed to forget that we were (at the core) just co-workers.<br />
We began our mini-Olympics around 10:00. The events were fairly simple, and none too difficult. (They were designed to be played by the dozen or so pregnant women currently at the office.) They included Bocce-Curling (get your ball the closest to the target), Cookie Stacking (stack Oreos as fast as you can in 30 seconds, using only one hand), Channelz (using five half-pipes, run a ball around an obstacle course, moving the ball from one channel to the next every 20 feet), Memory (remember what a bunch of articles are), and Balloon Toss (tossing a water balloon between two people, increasing the distance every throw).<br />
Oh, and there was one other event. As we arrived, 10 people volunteered for a &#8220;special event&#8221;. No-one knew what it was until it started: a Scavenger Hunt. A lot of people who didn&#8217;t volunteer wanted on, and a few who did volunteer wanted off. The details of the whole thing are still sketchy. We didn&#8217;t see the Hunters until just before lunch.<br />
Although I was part of Team Yellow, I spent most of my time running around between the various events, taking pictures. I gotta say: drinking beer and running don&#8217;t mix well at all.<br />
Participants were well-behaved. For about five minutes. I mean, come on! Put a bunch of people (mostly men, admittedly) in the vicinity of filled water balloons, and well, you&#8217;re gonna have some trouble. Suffice to say, every team that left the Balloon Toss went to their next event armed. It&#8217;s a good thing we had a sunny, warm day &#8212; a number of people got a wee bit damp. (Fortunately, our adolecently-minded staff had the decency not to aim water balloons at the women in white shirts.)<br />
Things calmed down a wee bit come lunchtime. That&#8217;s when everyone put their guns down and loaded up on food. (You&#8217;d be surprised how much acting like buffoons works up an appetite.) Nothing overly fancy &#8212; just hamburgers and salads.<br />
After lunch, we were left to our own devices. Some people went off wandering, some played mini-golf, and some went to play beach volleyball. The rest sat around and chatted. Resuming my photo run, I proceeded to find interesting things to take pictures of. For some reason, I started with beach volleyball.<br />
The five courts are wedged in the last curve of the bobsled/luge track. Unlike most of the other courts I&#8217;ve seen, these had more than the 2-3 inches that you end up driving your foot through into pavement. I took the opportunity to run around a bit and get a few action shots of people playing.<br />
My first memory card full, I took a moment to rest before heading back to get the second one. That&#8217;s when Ed suggested I come play with them. Still being inebriated enough not to know any better, I hopped out on the court.<br />
Now, this wasn&#8217;t a particularly bright idea on my part. My head (along with the rest of my body) was still swimming in ol&#8217; ethyl. The actions of volleyball &#8212; whipping the head around following the ball, diving, rolling, yelling &#8212; combine against your brain&#8217;s better judgement to stay in one place and lie down. Needless to say, it&#8217;s quite the argument my body got into.<br />
While in the midst of a set that I don&#8217;t really remember, I caught a glimpse of water balloons arcing over the trees. The angle required to get the balloons over the trees was so great that the balloons never came close to the courts. That didn&#8217;t stop me from annoucing (rather loudly) that if anyone hit my camera with one of those balloons, it would be the end of them.<br />
That statement would be my downfall.<br />
About 20 minutes later, Allard (my boss) caught us in between serves to borrow my little camera. Or rather, I thought that&#8217;s what he was looking for. In reality, he was checking to make sure I was camera-free. I hadn&#8217;t seen the audience on the hill carefully hiding my big camera.<br />
Next thing I know, there&#8217;s a line of people standing on the hill. They were in plain view. You know those old cowboy movies where the angry Indians all stand in a line at the top of a ridge? It was like that, only with water balloons. And no Indians.<br />
Somehow, instinctively, I knew to run. It didn&#8217;t matter &#8212; apparently, I&#8217;d earned the privilege of being the prime target. Two balloons bounced off me, but one made a direct hit in the front, followed moments later by one in the rear.<br />
Neil ran past. (Although he still claims his innocence, I have witnesses as to his involvement.) Picking up the two balloons, I chased him all over the courts. Then Neil got smart and stopped. Before I could do anything, he&#8217;d burst the balloon in my hand, and stepped on the other. Now balloon-less, there was only one other thing I could do: chase him.<br />
For all I know, I had a blood-curdling rebel yell as I chased Neil up the hill. Someone yelled out: &#8220;Tackle him! Go for the legs!&#8221; Remembering snippets of high school gym class, I dove and grabbed the legs. From what Arthur tells me, it was a textbook tackle. All I know is that the whole effort wore me out, and there&#8217;s no video evidence.<br />
I walked around damp for most of the afternoon (like I said, it&#8217;s a good thing it was warm), constantly shedding dried grass and sand from the escapade in the volleyball court. Although I can&#8217;t say I was the wettest that day, you could put me in the top rankings, I&#8217;m sure.<br />
The winners of the games were announced towards the end of the day. I wasn&#8217;t particularly paying attention, having reached what I can only assume was the bottom of my bottle, figuratively speaking. Team Green won, partly due to their skill (I can only assume) and subterfuge (which was widely known). Hey, it&#8217;s just a game&#8230;<br />
We returned to the office to begin the *second* event of the day. Thought we were over, didn&#8217;t you? Ha! If there&#8217;s one thing Critical Mass doesn&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s when to stop. Hmm&#8230; that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing&#8230;<br />
Vicious Circle was our next port of call. We didn&#8217;t all arrive at once, but before long a large portion of the company had packed themselves into a seat somewhere. And at Vicious Circle we sat, talked, drank, snacked, and took strange pictures of everyone who was there. And then suddenly, almost without warning, people began to filter out into the night.<br />
Torin, Adrian, Jim, and myself headed to Ceili&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;m not too sure why. We ran into a couple of people from CM, but after a quick search for anyone else in the building, we found outselves alone. This meant it was time to vacate. The problem, however, was that during our search, Jim decided it was time to get another beer. (For those of you who think *I* was far-gone, you needed to see Jim.) We didn&#8217;t much want to wait for Jim to finish his beer. No problem for him &#8212; he just slipped the 3/4-full pint into his pants pocket.<br />
Out the door and down Stephen Ave. &#8212; we were headed to SkyBar, where we knew the rest of the crew could be found. We didn&#8217;t get much further past Penny Lane when I caught a glimpse of a familiar face: Sean, aka Muck, aka my cousin Pam&#8217;s boyfriend. Pam, of course, was right there. We talked briefly (the others were waiting for me, and I couldn&#8217;t very well wait around too long) before resuming our quest to SkyBar.<br />
When we reached 1st St., Jim disappeared. We were across the street from Murrietta&#8217;s, one of the cooler bars/clubs downtown. That night, they had a live band playing p-funk (basically, horn-driven music). Jim blurted something about it, and next thing we knew, he was gone. We waited around a couple of minutes, but Jim was gone. (James and I would discuss this the next day &#8212; James received two completely unintelligable voicemails from Jim over the course of the night.)<br />
Torin, Adrian, and I continued to SkyBar. There we ran into Cyndy, Ashifa, a couple of Marks, and other people I don&#8217;t quite remember now. SkyBar cover was $15. We weren&#8217;t objected to it so much as we were STARVING. Conveniently enough, Saltlik was next door. On the order for a late-night snack: a peppercorn steak.<br />
It was midnight when we hit the streets again. I&#8217;d been up for 18 hours, had at least that many beers over the course of the day, been water-bombed, run ragged, and my feet suddenly decided to tell me they were ready for revolt. As much as I would have liked to go up to SkyBar, my body cried out in defeat. It was time to go home.<br />
The lights were off, and nobody was home. (Except the cats, of course.) I assumed Tamara was out having her own breed of fun that night. For some reason, though, I felt the urge to look for a note. I found one on my computer keyboard: &#8220;Back in a few days. Enjoy your weekend!&#8221; I laughed, though probably more from being too tired. I crawled into bed next to Spaz, who was rather upset that I was making her move.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait for next year!<br />

		<p>It seems that good things do happen to those who wait. Surprisingly enough, that also applies to me.<br />
You may recall some weeks ago, [[The Hell of my job|I lamented Critical Mass&#8217; ability to see the need to promote from within]]. It wasn&#8217;t so much about me as it was about using the resources we had, and not stalling forever on putting people into open positions.<br />
I kept raising the red flag. I was, well, a kind of whistle-blower, but only in reminding management that we were rapidly heading for a serious problem if we didn&#8217;t fill the position that I knew needed to be filled. I bugged Allard, and I bugged Cory. I wanted to make sure that we would have some sort of movement on the issue.<br />

		<p>I found out today that I&#8217;ve become middle management. I&#8217;ve become my own arch-nemesis.<br />
Critical Mass has (almost) finished its massive organizational effort. It&#8217;s not really a reorganization, per se, but it is a process that we&#8217;ve needed to go through for a very long time.<br />
This year, Critical Mass turns eight years old. It&#8217;s been almost six years since the launch of our first website. I&#8217;m employee #175, and new people are in the #400 range. We&#8217;ve got a lot of people that need organziation to get through their daily lives. So with the introduction of Thelton, our new COO (well, &#8220;new&#8221; as of September), we dove into the melee of putting an actual structure into Critical Mass.<br />

		<p>&#8220;Another year, come and gone&#8221; it wasn&#8217;t. This has perhaps been the single most turbulent year of my life. I had the deep low of my father&#8217;s death, coupled with the meteoric high of participating with the CBC 50th Anniversary train. Many times I thought I was going to lose my sanity or even my job. Perseverence, not to mention blind faith, helps moves things forward. But I did live up to a few things last year (see [[2001, A Year in Review]]): I spent more time out of the office.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are parties.<br />
Then there&#8217;s a Critical Mass party.<br />
Five years ago yesterday (4 July 1997), Critical Mass launched its first ever website, <a href="http://www.mbusa.com/">MBUSA.com</a>. That first launch wasn&#8217;t perfect, but it started a business relationship that has lasted ever since. MB is still our largest client, and the project I&#8217;ve been on for most of my time here.<br />
What&#8217;s that have to do with a party? Well, quite some time ago (a few months, to be exact), it was decided that we needed to celebrate the launch of our first website. And, this is the cool part, it was going to be a complete and utter surprise to everyone in the company.<br />
Except those who knew about it, anyway.<br />
I was one of those lucky few. I was asked to join the &#8220;Secret Committee&#8221; (or something equally quasi-mysterious). This group would help make the decisions that would affect everyone on that fateful day. This included things like activities, awards presentations, gifts, and so forth. It would also later expand to duties such as bus captain, and in my case, emcee.<br />
Having only returned from Ontario the day before, I would basically walk into an unsuspecting office for a whirlwind day of what I could only assume would be just short of a drunken mess. But I started off a little more sensibly: Charged camera batteries, a hat, sunscreen, and clothes that I knew I could wear all day without getting uncomfortable. I suggested to Tamara (my roommate &#8212; see [[Moving into my New (Old) House]] &#8212; who also works at Critical Mass) that she dress accordingly. I didn&#8217;t tell her why.<br />
I arrived at the office and proceeded to catch up on email that had been backing up for a couple of days. And when no-one was looking, I reviewed the script I was to read from. Before long, it was breakfast time. As per usual, I eat breakfast at the office (I pay $20 a month for the privilege). Normally, I&#8217;m there for about 15 minutes, and then I&#8217;m back at my desk. But this morning, we had to wait for an impromptu Town Hall meeting in the Bistro at 8:30.<br />
Di (our president) started a little after 8:30, and made a few quick announcements. The first was that we would not be coming in until noon the following day. This was expected &#8212; it was Stampede Parade Day. No company is open until noon on parade day. But there was another announcement.<br />
&#8220;Clear your calendars. You&#8217;re all going out at 10:30, and you&#8217;re not coming back until after 5pm.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And it&#8217;s mandatory.&#8221;<br />
There were mostly whoops from those in attendance. The rest were on the Mercedes Dealers team, who were behind in their work, and saw a day of productivity just vanish before their eyes. But the needs of the many must outweight the needs of the few &#8230; so happy we were.<br />
Productivity, suffice to say, disappeared while we awaited our 10:30 departure. This allowed me to get some more details out of the way. But before long, the PA sounded our call downstairs to board the busses. It was time to party.<br />
On the bus, no-one really knew what was going on &#8212; that, of course, was the point. We received our gifts (a pair of sunglasses, a buff, and a wristband that did something, though I&#8217;m not sure what), and the busses headed out to our first venue&#8230;<br />
The Southern Alberta Pioneer Memorial Lodge. Sounds impressive, but it&#8217;s little more than a restored hunting lodge and about an acre or so of ground. But it&#8217;s on a cliff overlooking the Elbow River, so it&#8217;s not too bad. Already set up were tables and chairs, the Bistro staff was already cooking lunch, and most importantly, the beer was already cold.<br />
Jay and I were to share emcee duties that day, but Jay (despite a flair for the dramatic) had a nasty case of stage fright. He gracefully ducked out and let me handle the various announcements. But this didn&#8217;t stop Jay and I from very quickly downing a couple of beers to try and take the nervousness off. (Jay moved a little faster than me, though.)<br />
After about 30 minutes, it was time to show my cards and let everyone know that I knew what was going on, and show to the company that people like me should never be let near a microphone.<br />
Suddenly, I developed a radio voice and became no better than the morning radio rock jockeys who get worked up at the slightest sound of anything. I had no idea where that all came from. It was a little creepy to say the least. But hey, strange things happen right out of the blue. (&#8216;Course, I wasn&#8217;t drinking that crap, I was into something much nicer.)<br />
The irony of all this was that in school, I *hated* giving presentations. I hated getting up in front of people. Public speaking was very, very bad. Yet here I was, completely comfortable in making an ass of myself, and actually surprised that people listened. It was &#8230; surreal.<br />
Lunch started and for a while people followed the rules of order. But soon, no-one cared, and everyone wanted to eat. Not a big deal &#8212; there was lots of opportunity, and lots of food. (I think we had leftovers.) I didn&#8217;t eat much, though &#8212; only enough to try offset all the beer I was putting back.<br />
After lunch came the Dinosaur Awards. These were presented by Di (the President) and Dan (the Senior Vice President of Client Services) to the original employees of Critical Mass, still with the company. The trophies were little clay statues of cartoon dinosaurs, each customized to the recipient (for example, our CTO &#8212; a former programmer &#8212; received one where the dinosaur was smashing computers).<br />
Following the awards ceremony, we started into the games. We had planned on holding a games to give people some time to enjoy watching each other act goofy. There are few people in our company who won&#8217;t give into the urge to act like an idiot from time to time.<br />
The first game was the Naughty Noodle Toss. Sounds worse than it is, but it&#8217;s still entertaining to watch. Basically, everyone stands in a circle. To some of these people are given two metre long &#8220;noodles&#8221;, which most people will recognize as swimming pool toys. These are slung between the legs. Noodles must then be passed to the person next to them without the use of their hands. A dropped noodle must be picked up without the use of the hands.<br />
And when everyone&#8217;s drunk (or at least slightly inebriated), it gets everyone laughing.<br />
We went through four games of this &#8212; three with two teams each (we had six teams in total), and one last game of the winning team of each of the previous three. It was quite a sight.<br />
The second game we played was the Single Shoe Scuttle. This one was even more nasty, though far less embarrassing. Everyone took off a shoe (or sandal, if that&#8217;s all they had), and placed it in a line. The team would then line up, and prepare to scramble around a small field with scattered dominoes. Two teams played at once, the winner was the team with the most dominoes. Although we did manage to play three games, we never got the grand championship, as we had to pack up and leave for the second venue.<br />
Normally, no-one would have known where we were going, but unfortunately, Ted (our founder and chairmain) accidentally let it slip that we would spend the rest of the day at The Whiskey (a bar a few blocks from the office). At this point, my last official announcing duties took place, and then we were off.<br />
We pretty much dominated the place. Everywhere you looked were CM employees with their buffs (worn a number of ways) and sunglasses. Getting even more drunk than at the Pioneer Lodge. But this was all part of the fun.<br />
Slowly, the sun started to set, and people drifted off. A few diehards stuck around until quite late, but I left earlier &#8212; around 9:30. Deciding I&#8217;d had too much fun (and beer) for one day, I opted for the trip home.<br />
To drink my body weight in water.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Coming into work on a Friday with a hangover is one of the worst feelings.<br />
Well, coming in on a Monday is probably worse, now that I think about it.<br />
Last night was Critical Mass&#8217; annual Christmas party. This year, we held it at the Scandinavian Centre in northwest Calgary. It&#8217;s basically a large hall &#8212; we needed something that could pack in about 400 people. But that wasn&#8217;t all that would be there&#8230;<br />
Chris, Adrian, Doug, and I arrived late. Chris had to make some last-minute changes to the video on our Christmas promotion, so we didn&#8217;t get to the party until nearly 7:30. (It started at 6:00.) Luckily, they hadn&#8217;t taken dinner away yet, so we got to partake of the meal.<br />
Turkey, of course.<br />
The awkwardness of being the last people to arrive soon subsided, and we started chatting with those around us. Luckily, the last available seats were with people we knew. Not sure if they saved them for us or not, but it still worked out.<br />
The entertainment began about a half hour after we arrived. First were a couple of speeches by Jerry (our CEO, based in Chicago) and Diane (our President, based here in Calgary). Then it really began. A man walked up on stage. Didn&#8217;t know who he was, had never seen him before. He wore a Santa hat, a suit with a bowtie, and wielded an accordion.<br />
That&#8217;s usually not a good sign.<br />
Okay, accordion music, I thought, I can handle that. Then someone started talking to the crowd. It wasn&#8217;t the accordion player. I looked around, trying to figure out where the sound was coming from. It was a lounge singer. A really bad, exceptionally cheesy, lounge singer. Hired to torture us. He made bad jokes, had bad hair, had really bad taste in clothes. In short, perfect for the job.<br />
At first, he just clowned around, trying to get us to accept that he was bad. Didn&#8217;t take a lot of effort. Then he switched into the next part of his act. Armed with what had to have been a premeditated choice, he pulled Dan (our Canadian Vice-President and head of the Mercedes account) on stage. To do a duet. Of Sonny and Cher. And Dan lost the coin toss.<br />
Not that Dan had a choice anyway&#8230;<br />
It got worse. After the Sonny and Cher revival, he grabbed three more people (all bald men) and had them be three of the Beatles. They sang &#8220;Twist and Shout&#8221;, and surprisingly well, I have to say. But then the coup de gras came when he found five more people (including two of our more introverted staff) to come up on stage and become &#8220;The Village People&#8221;.<br />
All in all, the guy&#8217;s act was pretty good. And we all really needed the laugh.<br />
Soon, the entertainment was over, and the dancing began. People milled, people talked, a few left early, but a large number held out to the end of the night. About 2:00am.<br />
Fortunately, we didn&#8217;t have to be in until 10:00am. Even then, some still showed up late. But today wasn&#8217;t a big day anyway &#8212; the office officially closed at 2:00pm MST.<br />
In other words, that&#8217;s the news, and I am outta here&#8230;<br />
To each of you, I wish the best of holidays and a safe break from your daily life. May you all have a wonderful time, and I&#8217;ll be writing more in the New Year!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When the temperature falls to -21 degrees with the wind chill, and the sky dumps 15 centimetres of snow on the ground, that&#8217;s when a young man&#8217;s fancy turns to&#8230;<br />
Revenge.<br />
Some months ago, Chris&#8217; and my collective birthday to be exact, our friend Teak decided that he would give us each a small token of &#8230; well, sugar. Specifically, a lunchbox full of it. When I opened my little gift, candy spilled all over my desk. How he managed to get the candy in there and the lid shut is beyond me&#8230;<br />
Needless to say, when word of Teak&#8217;s birthday came roaming around, Chris and I started thinking. Initially, it wasn&#8217;t anything mean or nasty, but then Chris joked about getting even with Teak for the months of sugar. (I still have some of mine.) It wasn&#8217;t too long before the joke turned serious, and it was time to execute.<br />
Step 1: The plan.<br />
This was perhaps the easiest part. The basic principle was sound: Get one of Teak&#8217;s desk-side cabinets (they&#8217;re a little over two feet tall, about one and a half feet deep, and a foot and a quarter wide &#8212; I don&#8217;t have a ruler, so these are estimates). Empty it. Then refill it. With candy. The trick, of course, was to do it when Teak wasn&#8217;t around (he&#8217;s been in the office late a lot, so working around that was a bit tricky).<br />
Step 2: The supplies.<br />
Sugar. And lots of it. In short, a trip to Costco, about the only place we can get such huge quantities of glucose goodness without completely breaking the bank. There&#8217;s a lot to consider when buying for a stunt such as this. You don&#8217;t want full-sized chocolate bars &#8212; they&#8217;re too big. Halloween ones would have been perfect, but those haven&#8217;t been in the stores for almost a month. You also have to be careful not to get too much of one thing. For example, too many M&amp;Ms, although perfect for something like this, means you need more of them. Also, you want variety.<br />
This meant we had to carefully choose our ammunition. I wish I&#8217;d remembered to bring the list of things we bought, but it&#8217;s along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four boxes of sour gummies (including cherry and watermelon flavours)</li>
<li>Two small tubs of more sour gummies</li>
<li>One tub of marshmallow rats (yes, rats)</li>
<li>One large tub of sugar lollipops</li>
<li>One small tub of Chupa Chups (lollipops)</li>
<li>One box of Blue Whales (gummies that taste like those blue freezies)</li>
<li>A couple packages of marshmallow peaches</li>
<li>Two huge bags of M&amp;Ms (peanut variety)</li>
<li>Two bags of Jelly Belly jelly beans</li>
<li>One container of candy necklaces</li>
<li>One tub of Double Bubble gum (the ones with Bazooka Joe comics)</li>
<li>Three boxes of chocolate and caramel Rice Krispie squares (about the healthiest thing we threw in)</li>
<li>One large bag of Werther&#8217;s (sp?) caramels</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s probably more, but we were having too much fun shopping for this stuff.<br />
Step 3: The prank.<br />
I was in the office again this weekend, partly because I had some work to do, partly because I&#8217;m overhauling my personal website (coming soon to a URL near you), and on Sunday, because I had to know when Teak wasn&#8217;t here anymore.<br />
Around 6:30pm, I took a short trip upstairs. First good news: Teak wasn&#8217;t there. Second good news: Neither was anyone else. Best good news: The poor fool had left his cabinet unlocked. A little after 7:00, Chris called to say he was ready to have fun. I whipped over to the apartment, picked up my roommate and brother in mischief, and returned to the office.<br />
The security guard was puzzled to say the least when we walked in with two huge boxes overflowing with packages of candy. We went upstairs to the Creative Services floor, and found that the lights were still off. (I&#8217;d turned them off when I&#8217;d inspected the floor earlier.)<br />
The first thing we had to do was clean out his cabinet &#8212; the lower part, anyway. Teak had a lot of files, which would of course get in the way when trying to empty the various tubs, boxes, and bags. Fortunately, there are other cabinets which weren&#8217;t in use. A simple transfer, and we were on our way.<br />
Almost &#8230; first, we had to line the lower bin with waxed paper. We didn&#8217;t want to make a total mess.<br />
Then came the fun part &#8212; filling the drawers. Taking several containers, we started pouring. Mind you, this isn&#8217;t some random thing &#8212; you have to do it carefully. You don&#8217;t want to make a parfait of candy &#8212; you want a nice, even dispersion. We had to mix a few times to get the right distribution. But the end effect looks &#8230; nasty, actually, and the smell&#8217;s quite powerful.<br />
Filling the lower drawer, we proceeded to the upper drawer (filling it with mostly small stuff, including M&amp;Ms, and finally the top bin (which sits under the seat), also nice and full. The surprising part was that we&#8217;d had leftovers. We&#8217;d originally thought we didn&#8217;t have enough, and worried that the joke would only be partially realized. But &#8217;tis better to have too much and do the job right than not have enough and do a half-assed job.<br />

The final touch was on Teak&#8217;s computer. Like most of our Designers, he has two monitors (one is usually for seeing the artwork, the second for all the tools). Chris made up two images that were placed on the backgrounds of each of the monitors. One read &#8220;Sugar is sweet.&#8221;, the other &#8220;Revenge is sweeter.&#8221;<br />
I couldn&#8217;t stop giggling the entire time. I so wanted to put up a camera and videotape Teak&#8217;s arrival this morning. I so wish I could have seen the look on his face.<br />
Ah well, all&#8217;s well that ends well. At least until Teak tries to up the ante. If he&#8217;s smart, he won&#8217;t &#8212; starting an arms race with us is &#8230; foolish.<br />
All I can say is: There&#8217;s always room for&#8230;</p>

		<p>If there&#8217;s one thing Critical Mass knows how to do, it&#8217;s getting its employees horribly, horribly drunk.<br />
Last year, this was courtesy of the Getaway in Westbank (see [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]]). However, owing to financial downturns in the hi-tech sector as a whole (and our industry in particular, following the dot bomb), we&#8217;ve had to scale back. It&#8217;s probably a good thing &#8212; &#8220;The Trip&#8221; would have set the company back $120,000. That&#8217;s two people&#8217;s salaries for the year and the cost of our new Summer Social.<br />
This year, we didn&#8217;t even leave the city. Instead, we went to a place called &#8220;Symon&#8217;s Valley Ranch&#8221;, basically little more than an over-glorified RV park. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; it&#8217;s not *that* bad. Just that it had a lot of people wondering for a while. I think the intention was good, but I wonder if (assuming we have a Social next year) we&#8217;ll go back.<br />
My day started around 1:30pm, when I arrived at the office. (Chris would not attend the Social this year &#8212; a friend was making a short visit to town, and he wanted to spend most of the day with them. I would take the company-sponsored bus to the Social, as Chris needed the car.) Several people were already there. Already the trash talk for the Big Game was starting&#8230;<br />
Trash talk, you ask? That&#8217;s the Soccer game. We have a men&#8217;s soccer team. They&#8217;re good &#8230; not stellar, but they&#8217;ve won better than half their games this year, so they&#8217;re better than average. However, the challenge was put forth &#8212; we&#8217;ve got a lot of very active women here, too. Although not on a team, they claimed they&#8217;d whip the men&#8217;s team in a match. Part of the afternoon&#8217;s events would include a short soccer game.<br />
Although the busses (there were three of them) were to depart at 2:00 sharp, we didn&#8217;t have enough people to fill even one bus. (Our staff, regrettably, have a nasty tendency of being late, or not showing at all.) As it turned out, most drove to the Ranch (located in the northwest quadrant of the city). But those of us who took the bus were the cool ones.<br />
We finally left at about 2:15, one of the busses staying around just in case stragglers finally appeared. As our bus weaved it&#8217;s way through the downtown streets, I heard the clinking of bottles &#8212; one of the Delichte brothers had smuggled beer in his knapsack and was spreading it around. This caught the attention of Di (our company president). The bus didn&#8217;t even make it out of downtown&#8230;<br />
&#8230;before we stopped to make a beer run. Di, Jason, Philippe, and Tamara all raced down the block, returning with a couple flats of beer and a box of coolers. We were finally ready for the trip.<br />
I was admittedly a little disappointed when we arrived at Symon&#8217;s Valley. I had expected at least a couple of trees. But the northwest is much more like prairie scrubland than other parts, so I guess I shouldn&#8217;t have been too surprised.<br />
Symon&#8217;s Valley is (or at least looks to be) primarily an RV park, which sits on the west half of the lot. The east half has a gravel parking lot, a pair of softball fields, and the buildings. The buildings are primarily a ring of ramshackle facades, made to look like an old western ghost town &#8230; or at least look like they were built to look like an old western ghost town. For all I know, they&#8217;re falling apart and no-one&#8217;s fixing them.<br />
The main portion is the mess hall, which can accommodate our large numbers (probably one of the reasons why we went there) and a small bar. The entire motif is western, of course, which means a lot of wood, and a lot of kitsch. But what fun is a faux western ranch without kitsch, anyway?<br />
The bar, of course, was free. That took us about five minutes to figure out. It was unlimited, too. Also a bad thing. We had four days of drinking to make up in a few short hours. (Or at least that was the resounding belief.) We got started as soon as possible.<br />
Around 4:00, the call for the Big Game began to circulate. It was time to find out who got bragging rights for the next year. (And believe me, it would last that long.) The Ranch emptied out onto the softball fields &#8212; the only place big enough for a game. Although there were no goal posts or lines on the field for soccer, a few plastic markers would define the field of battle.<br />
The men were already out, changed into their near-luminescent orange shirts, and limbering up for the game. With Survivor&#8217;s &#8220;Eye of the Tiger&#8221; playing, the women&#8217;s team raced onto the field, ready for battle.<br />
The game was a shortened one &#8212; normally an hour in length, this game ran only 40 minutes. The rules were also bent a little more &#8212; six men versus 14 women. Yes, slightly different odds, but you have to remember that the men had been playing together all season, whereas the women&#8217;s team was thrown together about five minutes before the game started.<br />
It took a while for the women&#8217;s team to get into gear, but with the help of Carmen and Max (who lead the cheers from the sidelines), the women managed to hold the men to a 2-2 game. Bragging rights, such as they were, would be limited to the individuals that day.<br />
Returning to the hall, we proceeded to watch people attempt to ride the mechanical bull. (This was the entertainment for the adults &#8212; the finger painting and popsicle-stick picture frame making had been earlier in the afternoon.) There&#8217;s nothing more fun than watching your co-workers attempt to stay on a hydraulically-driven chunk of fibreglass &#8230; well, actually, there are lots of things more fun, just not at Symon&#8217;s Valley.<br />
Dinner appeared before too long, and we all lined up for grub. It was basically what you&#8217;d expect to see at a picnic &#8212; coleslaw, potato salad, buns, baked potatoes, but we also had roast beef and roast chicken. The beef was a little overdone, but nothing to make it really bad.<br />
Before long, the announcement came &#8212; it was time to board the busses again. Our time at Symon&#8217;s Valley was over and we had to go home. It seemed almost a waste that it was only 8pm.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought that.<br />
As I approached the busses, Eryn informed me that one bus was going to Critical Mass, the other bus was going to Di&#8217;s house. Upon querying the destination of the second bus, I learned that Di had decided to invite a whole mess of people over for a post-picnic get-together.<br />
Most of us boarded the party bus.<br />
Di wasn&#8217;t there when we arrived, but Phil (her husband and one of our copywriters) was onboard, and so let us in. I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure if Phil had been aware of the ensuing party &#8212; but he seemed to be keen about it anyway. We were settled barely 10 minutes when Di, Laura, and Mel pulled up with the beverages.<br />
Flats of beer. 24 cans to a flat. 15 flats in total. (Did I mention that Di&#8217;s our company president?)<br />
My exact words: &#8220;Ooh, it&#8217;s gonna get ugly.&#8221;<br />
The next five hours were a bit of a blur. I don&#8217;t remember entirely everything that happened. But generally, silliness and stupidity abounded. My camera started making the rounds, carried and operated by others, so I still managed to get a record of the ensuing mayhem.<br />
I bailed out around 2:30 in the morning, though I can&#8217;t say with exact certainty. I was drunk. Very drunk. The party continued until the wee hours of the morning, when the cops finally showed up to shut everything down. A true sign of a good party.<br />
Needless to say, following Saturday&#8217;s debauchery, I&#8217;ll not be doing any celebrating any time soon. It takes a lot of energy to do all that, and after a weekend like the one I just had, I&#8217;ll need a little time to recuperate.<br />
Besides, I still have a hangover&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Although it&#8217;s been a very long time since I was a scout, I still try to do good deeds. Last night, nine dedicated CMassers did a good deed.<br />
Owing to employee pressure, Critical Mass started doing charity work some months ago. So far, it&#8217;s entailed a head-shaving fundraiser, an auction, and a couple of food drives (I think &#8212; some of the beginning of this year is a bit blurry). We&#8217;re getting into Habitat for Humanity, though we haven&#8217;t done anything with it yet.<br />
One thing we have done a few times, and this is a regular activity for us, is to make dinner one night at month at the Mustard Seed Street Ministry kitchen, for Calgary&#8217;s financially inhibited. We donate the majority of the food for that meal, and the labour to create it. Last night was my first crack at the kitchen.<br />
We headed over at 4:00 to the &#8220;Seed&#8221; (as it&#8217;s referred to by its staff) to start preparation. We had to chop and cook everything we had with us. Mercy, the Bistro manager and our head chef, headed over early to get started. Within a few minutes of arriving, we were mercilessly chopping celery, broccoli, bok choy (I was &#8220;Bok Choy Boy&#8221;), onions (luckily, they had a machine which did most of the work, but we had to peel and quarter them first), and carrots (I was on peeling detail).<br />
Early into the cutting process, I started to notice a strong stinging sensation in my right hand. I noticed, much to my chagrin, that the knife I was using was literally scraping skin off my forefinger. Most knives are thin metal plates with either plastic or wood wrapped around (or tacked to the side of) the handle. This knife had a serious user interface problem &#8212; the wood was too short, and left an 1/8 inch strip jutting out the top. Although not as sharp as the blade (which was pretty darn sharp, let me tell you), it was enough to peel off some skin. I donned a surgical glove for the remainder of the evening.<br />
Part way through the chopping, I was asked to help out with another task. While four of us cut veggies, three others were chopping fruit. We were making fruit salad for dessert. A lot of fruit salad. About 50 pounds of it, as near as I can tell. It had to be mixed in a very large pot, and I somehow landed the task of stirring the mass of fruit.<br />
With my arm.<br />
I was up to my elbow in melon and strawberries. It was a peculiar sensation, to say the least. It would have probably been a lot more pleasant if the fruit were warmer, but it was still chilled from refrigeration. My fingers were numb after a few minutes. That said, it felt like I was doing a remake of the kitchen scene from &#8220;9 1/2 Weeks&#8221;.<br />
We were making a stupidly large amount of food. The Seed is well-equipped for such a meal, though, complete with a huge array of pots of varying sizes (ranging from gigantic to titanic), scoops that can take about over a litre of contents at once, massive ovens that cooked eight huge pans of rice, an immense grill we used for stir frying the veggies, and a &#8230; uh &#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what to call it &#8230; a square caldron we used for cooking the sweet and sour chicken.<br />
Although I don&#8217;t have a complete recipe, here&#8217;s the one we used to make the sweet and sour chicken:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>80 lb</td>
<td>Cubed, cooked meat (chicken)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15 lb</td>
<td>Onions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15</td>
<td>Garlic cloves, crushed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4&#215;100 oz</td>
<td>Pineapple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 L</td>
<td>Soy sauce</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 cups</td>
<td>Brown sugar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 cups</td>
<td>Vinegar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20 L</td>
<td>Water</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>It all fit into that one cauldron.<br />
Add to that 50 lbs of fruit salad, three very large pots (each about 50 lbs) of vegetables, and at least 40 lbs of rice &#8230; that&#8217;s a lot of food. Aside from the vegetables, it was mostly cooked by 6:30, at which time the staff (including volunteers and ourselves) got to eat. Despite the mass quantities of food, it was still quite tasty. And the rice turned out much better than I thought was possible in an oven (better than any rice I&#8217;ve ever made).<br />
Then the rush started. Heather, Steve, Bill, Therese, and Eryn took the frontline for serving, Carla helped dispense coffee and tea, Mercy cooked the vegetables, and Jen and I did the grunt labour of keeping the serving trays full and the vegetables flowing to the grill to be cooked.<br />
The four and a half hours disappeared, and soon it was 8:30, which is when the kitchen closes. There wasn&#8217;t much left &#8212; a little for lunch, but that was about it. At that point, we were free to leave. All we had to do was cut, cook, and serve. Other staff were responsible for cleaning up after our mess. (And we made a pretty decent one, although it was hard to tell by the end &#8212; the Seed staff are very quick at cleaning up.)<br />
As we began to shut up the kitchen, signifying the end of dinner, one of the Seed&#8217;s patrons stuck his head in through one of the serving windows, to say thanks for dinner. He said something like this:<br />
&#8220;Y&#8217;know the movie &#8216;Angels in the Outfield&#8217;? Well, we got Angels in the kitchen!&#8221;<br />
We had served about 500 people, although we have yet to receive an exact number. We were feeling really good about ourselves. Until we went outside, that is.<br />
There were about a hundred people who hadn&#8217;t been able to get in. A hundred people who wouldn&#8217;t get dinner. It was sobering to realize that for all those you do help, there are always more in need. It just emphasized that what we are doing is in no way trivial.<br />
It&#8217;s also in no way easy. I was sore. I was physically exhausted. And my feet were ready to declare themselves a separate and distinct society from the rest of my body. But it was very rewarding. I opted to skip a movie last night, and instead curled up in a chair at home to rest.<br />
I will help at the Seed again, that much is for certain. Just not until my feet stop pounding.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It was once said that the only thing to fear is fear itself. Fear is the oppressor of souls and nations. It is the beginnings of hatred and suffering. And it&#8217;s what has kept me away from Vancouver. Fear of my past. Fear of opening old wounds.<br />
This is why on Friday past, one year, two months, and four days since I left Vancouver, that I felt it was time to face those fears.<br />
Well, actually, it was a month earlier that I made the decision, but you get my point&#8230;<br />
It basically stemmed from one email I received from my friend Greg, suggesting I come out to see a baseball game in Seattle with some of my former co-workers (and current friends) from Radical. It was part spur-of-the-moment, part &#8220;I really need to get out of this office for a couple days!&#8221;, but when it really came down to it, it was time for me to go back.<br />
I&#8217;d had the opportunity a couple times before, the most recent previous one being an invitation to Katrina&#8217;s &#8220;Glug&#8221; party, a tradition she and Guy have at Christmas. However, I&#8217;d never really felt ready. I had always said I was busy (which was true), but primarily, I knew that mentally and emotionally, I hadn&#8217;t forced off my demons &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t ready to go back.<br />
Rising early on Friday, I made my way to the airport to catch my 7:50am flight to Vancouver. I took public transit, partly for the heck of it, and partly so I&#8217;d get a better idea of times for the next time I do this. Not having the best information available on times and schedules, I ended up with about 20 minutes to wait for the bus once I&#8217;d reached the end of the C-Train line.<br />
I watched the sun rise above the houses, casting long shadows across the bus terminal, and shedding light on a dawn of reawakening. (It&#8217;s amazing the stuff you can dish out when you&#8217;re being philosophical, eh?) It was my first real thoughts about what I was about to do. Would I run into my past, and would she confront me? Would I see any of her friends? And more importantly, what would I do? These were questions I was unable to answer, even though I&#8217;ve been thinking about that very thing for over a year.<br />
Soon I found myself at the airport, awaiting the boarding for the flight. Unlike my previous flights with Air Canada (see [[Christmas in Oakville, New Years Eve in Calgary]]), this flight left right on time. The flight was uneventful &#8212; up, breakfast, read, down. All told, about an hour and 10 minutes.<br />
Descending into Vancouver was &#8230; weird. I recognized everything. Surrey, Coquitlam, Burnaby, New Westminster, the Port Mann Bridge, Metrotown, the Richmond Auto Mall, IKEA. It almost felt like I&#8217;d never left, but at the same time, there was a strange feeling. Something between excitement and knowing you&#8217;re being watched.<br />
BC Transit being on strike, I had to take a taxi to get out of the airport. (Although Greg had offered to pick me up, I had told him not to waste his time &#8212; I knew he already had a killer schedule, and going to the airport is quite a bit out of his way.) The trip was quite, pleasant, and a brisk drive down memory lane. In less than 20 minutes, I was standing on the corner of 10th and Granville, wondering what I was going to do next.<br />
The first thing I did was call Lee, who had been Radical&#8217;s Director of QA and the coach of the Rad Sox. Being already at work, we agreed to meet that night, as planned, at Soho&#8217;s in Yaletown. I so proceeded to step #2 &#8212; wait. I wanted to hold off until about 9:30 before calling Katrina (another friend and former co-worker), but I didn&#8217;t want to disturb her too early in the morning. (More on this in a few paragraphs.)<br />
So it was off to one of a thousand local Starbuck&#8217;s to indulge in my second hot chocolate of the morning (the first being at the Blenz in Calgary airport). I sat, sipping my venti, and really thought about where I was. I actually sat with my back to the door, a little worried about who might walk through it.<br />
Irrational fears are the worst kind.<br />
After pondering the state of affairs for about a half hour (ventis are pretty big), I retreated to the moist Vancouver air, and proceeded to contact Katrina. I had hoped to meet up with her that morning, as I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what I was going to do that day. I had originally hoped to meet up with Lee for coffee, and then visit with Katrina later that morning. However, things don&#8217;t always go according to plan &#8212; Katrina was busy getting all the things she and her husband needed to pack everything in their home so they could move to San Francisco.<br />
I sat next to Katrina for two years. She&#8217;s one of the people I miss most about Vancouver, along with several of my co-workers. They were what made my life there happier than it would have been. But now Katrina was also an ex-Radicalite, and moving on with her life by accepting a position at Pixar. Yes, the same people who brought you the &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; movies and &#8220;A Bug&#8217;s Life&#8221;. Not only am I impressed, but I can actually say I know someone at Pixar. This was too cool.<br />
Resigning myself to having a morning on my own, I proceeded to run errands. First was a quick stop to the bank to deposit a rebate cheque (I had to deposit it in person, and getting to the bank during the day ain&#8217;t easy). I then stopped quickly at Bernard Callebaut to pick up some chocolates as a kind of &#8220;bon voyage&#8221; present for Katrina and Guy.<br />
Then I wandered. I wander well, particularly when I have nothing else to do, and I know (more or less) where I&#8217;m going.<br />
I headed towards downtown along Granville. I decided I wanted to go to Burrard Inlet and look around. It wasn&#8217;t a great day &#8212; the sky was overcast and I was being spit on periodically from above &#8212; but it was good day for looking around. But being in a wandering mood, I made a side trip through Granville Island, one of my favourite places in the city.<br />
On my way in, I stopped to donate some spare change to Jack &#8220;The Bear&#8221;, a self-employed social worker who strives to make his &#8220;group&#8221; (whomever they are) better off. I&#8217;d seen and heard of this guy before, and not being in a rush, I allowed myself (somewhat unwittingly) to end up in a half-hour pseudo-speech. He&#8217;s an articulate man, and he certainly has some interesting ideas. I tried to offer a few suggestions (his ideas, though good, need the odd improvement), but getting a word in edgewise is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s easier sliding papers between the blocks of the Western Wall in Jerusalem.<br />
I wandered about the Island a bit, and went into the market. They say that smell is one of the most powerful memory triggers. The second I walked in the door, it felt like someone was force feeding me 1,000 TV channels at once as snippets of two years suddenly raced through my mind. Some good, some bad &#8230; but after a moment, all I could smell was the produce, and food is always good. It took a lot of will power to get out of the market without buying anything.<br />
I exited the Island via the Aquabus, which ferried me to the other side of False Creek. This was far better than walking all the way back to the foot of the Granville Street Bridge, and then walking all the way back downtown again. I hadn&#8217;t really noticed how much I missed the smell of the sea, not until I got near the water. The smell is unmistakable, and wonderful. I think I was a fish in a previous life&#8230;<br />
The wandering continued as I worked my way down Granville. Not much had changed &#8212; same stores, same buildings, even some of the same people. The city line had a few new condos, and there was the odd old building reduced to a parking lot, but otherwise it was the same. Tagging (a form of graffiti) was very prevalent, especially at the Paradise and Caprice theatres (both now closed). Not unsurprising, I hate to say. The Eaton&#8217;s was open again. A new pub sat kiddie-corner, which had been abandoned or under construction during the entire time I was in Vancouver. A new London Drugs is open at the corner of Granville and Georgia. It used to be book store, which went under when Chapters moved into town. The London Drugs had moved from its old store further down the road, now open to anyone silly enough to lease the space.<br />
Canada Place was seeing some new construction. I had vaguely remembered a plan to expand the pier to increase convention space. The plan, it seemed, was thoroughly under way. As such, my favourite vantage point to view Burrard Inlet was unavailable. Instead, I took up a viewpoint on the promenade between Waterfront Station and the Province&#8217;s building.<br />
Although the view was essentially the same as the last time I&#8217;d viewed it, something seemed different. Not as much life &#8212; it seemed almost a little dead. I don&#8217;t know if it was a changed perspective due to my departure a year earlier, or if it was the weather. It almost looked like someone had dropped out some of the colour from the image I was seeing.<br />
I was still a little afraid, I think.<br />
Through Waterfront Station, and onto Water Street, I walked through Gastown. Not much had changed there, either. A couple stores had moved, a couple closed, and one lot (or building, I&#8217;m not sure which) had been opened up. I think there had been a restaurant there once, but I can&#8217;t really remember. The same burned out husk of a building sat across the street from the Olde Spaghetti Factory, though the structure supports had been beefed up a lot. I shook my head, wondering what on earth was going on there.<br />
I turned up Carrall Street, and headed back towards False Creek, Science World glinting in the distance. In moments, I realized that I&#8217;d made a bit of a blunder. This is what I get for pondering and not paying attention. I found myself at the corner of Carrall and W. Hastings. It&#8217;s known as Pigeon Park, and has the highest murder rate of any location in Canada. It&#8217;s not pleasant during the day &#8230; but you don&#8217;t go near it at night. I briskly walked through and on across the road. I didn&#8217;t feel safer until a couple of blocks later.<br />
I stalled a bit longer (I wasn&#8217;t due at Radical until almost 1pm) and made a side trip through the International Village, a large mall, still mostly empty over a year and a half since it opened. It looks really nice, but I wonder how much money they must lose from the lack of tenants.<br />
Up Abbott, I arrived at Pacific. This took me over towards Quebec Street, and onto Terminal Avenue. I was in the home stretch. Aside from Greg, I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone from Radical in over a year. Fear was rapidly being overcome by nervous combination of excitement and panic.<br />
My first run-in was with Fernando and one of the Foundation developers, whose name I couldn&#8217;t remember, even though he started at Radical the same day I did (my panic began to rise as I realized I couldn&#8217;t remember names). A few moments later, I entered the foyer of Radical&#8217;s new home, and headed right to the top floor.<br />
The receptionist I didn&#8217;t recognize. Lisa was gone, so I find out, having quit back in the summer. Greg could not be found, nor could Joel. Luckily, we could find Neall. As I waited for him to arrive, I heard my name being called by Allison. She had also started the same day as me, but unlike myself, was quite comfortable at her job. She looked good as ever, and still bore the same wonderful smile she always seemed to have.<br />
Neall hadn&#8217;t changed much, either &#8212; though I was just as happy to see him again. The reunions started to come quickly as Dave appeared through the main door, and Fred from the back office. Names were flitting around in my head so fast, I knew I was going to be in trouble. I nearly forgot Fred&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Neall offered to take me on a quick tour, and show me what Radical had moved in to. Having used up all their old space, Radical had taken a lease in a near-brand new building, and had the interior made up to their specifications. It&#8217;s quite nice, really &#8230; especially the log cabin in the common room.<br />
Yes, a log cabin. It&#8217;s their home theatre. I&#8217;ve seen and heard of some pretty wacky things in companies, but this is one of the wackiest. The common room at Radical is two stories tall, and easily big enough to fit a small house. It also has a 270+ degree view of Vancouver, including what must be a magnificent view of the North Shore.<br />
A new building, but it wasn&#8217;t much different than the old building &#8212; totally organic space, managers in the middle, work teams scattered around the outside. Greg had commented that Critical Mass&#8217; building looks more polished, but for the environment, I know a lot of people here would prefer Radical&#8217;s setup.<br />
Eric was still in a dungeon. This is where he likes to be &#8212; in the dark, away from everyone. I assume it lets him get on with his work. Martin was with him, discussing physics calculations. Mark was in the office he shared with Neall, looking none the worse for wear. Across from the office was Jean-Luc and Senta (whose name I sadly forgot, and I felt like such a heel for forgetting it), and a desk away was Nigel. He summed up my return rather succinctly: &#8220;The more things change, the more they stay the same.&#8221;<br />
Down the floor, I ran into Lisa (the office manager) and Cliff (one of the IT guys). I inadvertently interrupted their conversation, but they didn&#8217;t seem to mind too much. Neall took me down a floor to show me around a bit more. There were a lot of familiar faces, but many of them without names. I was now feeling particularly bad about forgetting so many people. It wasn&#8217;t until later that I remembered Yayoi&#8217;s and Rod&#8217;s names, something I&#8217;m not horribly proud of. Jesse seemed a bit surprised to see me, but then I don&#8217;t think he knew I was coming out.<br />
Returning to the seventh floor, I finally found Greg. He immediately started to apologize for not being around. Greg was up to his neck in E3 preparations. The game he&#8217;s working on has to be down there for exhibition, and there were still a lot of issues to clear up. Although it had been planned a month in advance, I hadn&#8217;t picked the best weekend to come out.<br />
Just before lunch, I finally ran into Tim, my old boss. He&#8217;s now one of the VPs (Neall is now the head of Pure3D), although I don&#8217;t know of what specifically. He had always been a fairly serious person while I was there, but he seemed somehow happier. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the haircut, but he looked better off.<br />
Members of Pure3D (Neall, Mark, Nigel) and Pure3D alumni (Kevin, Greg, Gabe, and myself) all went out for lunch, to a place called The Whip. (Gabe picked us up; like me, Gabe is also an ex-Radicalite.) It seemed somehow wrong that we weren&#8217;t eating anything Asian. Pure3D ritual had been typically Chinese. This was definitely not Chinese &#8230; although it was very tasty. The conversation, though, was definitely Pure3D.<br />
The more things change&#8230;<br />
After lunch, I finally met up with Joel. He&#8217;d been a bit of a harder character to find, being the lead programmer for one of Radical&#8217;s projects (meetings being the bane of his existence). He looked tired, like everyone else on the team. Being sick probably didn&#8217;t help much, either. We talked for a while, but I chose to keep the conversation fairly short, as he was busy dealing with the crises of getting a game ready for E3.<br />
I took the opportunity to leave Radical and go visit with Katrina and Guy. By now, it was raining outside, so I was quite happy to find the Aquabus still running between Science World and Stamp&#8217;s Landing, where Katrina and Guy live. They were home, and it only took a few moments (with a bit of direction) to get down to their slip.<br />
Oh, did I mention they live on a sailboat?<br />
This was why it was so difficult for them to get ready to move. Not only do they have to pack their belongings, they have to move their house as well. Logically, not an easy move. But they seemed fairly calm about it &#8212; most people get downright cranky when they move.<br />
I spent most of the afternoon with them, talking for a while, but them helping them pack. It was partly because I wanted to get the skinny on their move. It had come out of nowhere (at least from my perspective), and I was very curious to get their thoughts on it. They were excited. New place, new challenges, and it sounded like a lot of fun. Not wanting to get in their way of packing, I&#8217;d also offered to help them pack. Katrina and I spent the afternoon wrapping things in bubble wrap.<br />
I probably stayed longer than I really should have, but I felt compelled to not just drop in for a few minutes and then bolt. After all, I&#8217;d spent two years sitting next to Katrina, working with her, talking with her, and learning from her. Besides, until I go to San Francisco, I don&#8217;t know when (or even if) I&#8217;ll ever see her again.<br />
At 7:00, all three of us had to leave. Katrina and Guy were going to a friend&#8217;s place, and I was due to go to SoHo&#8217;s and meet up with Lee (and hopefully, people whose names I could remember). Despite being nearly 40 minutes late by the time I got there, I was the first to show. (Hopefully, we didn&#8217;t scare off any other potential revellers.) The second person to arrive was Ryan, a Radicalite whom I wasn&#8217;t sure was there to come out with us, or was meeting other friends. Luckily, he remembered me, and reintroduced himself. I was glad, because even when I was at Radical, I really didn&#8217;t know who he was&#8230;<br />
We talked at length until Lee arrived. You&#8217;d swear no time had passed since the last time I&#8217;d seen her. She didn&#8217;t look a day older, and was just as upfront as ever, just the way we love her. It didn&#8217;t take long for any awkwardness to pass. Soon, we were embroiled in animated conversation, along with one of Lee&#8217;s co-workers, who had also come out. Not too many Radicalites (ex or otherwise) came out that night, although I was very happy to see Lisa (the ex-receptionist) again. I&#8217;d always thought I&#8217;d gotten along with her very well, and had missed saying &#8220;hi&#8221; to her every morning.<br />
Somewhere in the evening, I stopped looking over my shoulder. I stopped looking in the shadows. I stopped being apprehensive. It was like I suddenly knew the story, like I&#8217;d already seen the movie and knew exactly when the creepy, half-dead monster leaps out. It was like the fear had dissipated like morning fog. Sure, the past will always be there, but spending the day in Vancouver, and with my friends, had shown me there was nothing to fear. It was only then that I truly felt relaxed.<br />
Neall appeared around 10:30, and joined our little group. Greg made a brief appearance, only to apologize for not coming out. The debate of where I would stay that night (begun earlier in the day) apparently had been solved &#8212; Neall would drop me off at Mark&#8217;s on our way home in preparation for the next day. This left Greg to quickly go to a friend&#8217;s birthday party, catch a few hours sleep, and get back to work early the next day. Sadly, because of the deadline, Greg wasn&#8217;t coming with us.<br />
Neall and I finally managed to leave SoHo&#8217;s around 12:30. I gave Lee a big hug (we&#8217;d had a good, deep conversation for most of the night, and I remembered all over again why I missed being around people like her), and stepped out into the cool night. Neall and I walked back to Radical, enjoying the walk, and talking about the state of Radical. It was refreshing to see how things had evolved since I&#8217;d left. It was very reassuring to see that management (including Neall, now that&#8217;s he&#8217;s part of the &#8220;establishment&#8221;) still has a firm grip and good steer of the Good Ship Radical.<br />
Fires were raging when we got into the office. A Pure3D patch hadn&#8217;t taken well, and Neall had to help out Vlad (the technical director) to get the software working again. Also, we were giving Eric a lift, and he was still working out a few issues with a demo he was programming. (He&#8217;d been at it since late Wednesday, I believe &#8230; non-stop. He hadn&#8217;t gone home.) Due to these reasons, we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 2:30. This also meant I was now staying at Neall&#8217;s, because it was now too late to go to Mark&#8217;s.<br />
I crashed on Neall&#8217;s couch that night. I was exhausted. I&#8217;d been up for just about 23 hours straight since that morning, walked about 10 kilometres since that morning, ate almost nothing outside of a sandwich at lunch, and was ready to fall dead. I was asleep in seconds.<br />
The alarm came far too early for my liking. But we had to get rolling fast &#8212; we had a baseball game to go to. Although the game didn&#8217;t start until 1:05pm, we had to pick up Neall&#8217;s sister, drive to Mark&#8217;s, pick up Gabe, and then drive to Seattle. It&#8217;s not a long drive, but it still takes time. Although we moved as fast as possible, we were delayed by a mysterious case of nose bleed, which I have yet to explain. (It plagued me the entire weekend.)<br />
After a slight detour to pick up Angie (Neall&#8217;s sister), we arrived at Mark and Carol&#8217;s to switch to a different vehicle. Our trip to Seattle would be in style &#8212; a Warner Brothers edition Chevy Venture. Nothing like being able to play video games and watch movies during the trip. Then it was off through to the west end of Richmond to pick up Gabe. It was almost 10am by the time we were all on our way to the border.<br />
We arrived in Seattle around noon. Mark deftly whizzed us through the various onramps and city streets towards the Port of Seattle, where Safeco Field lies. (It&#8217;s adjacent to the site of the former Kingdome, now the site of the new football stadium.) You can&#8217;t miss Safeco Field &#8212; it&#8217;s big. And it&#8217;s colour is unique for the area it sits in. There I found that Carol wasn&#8217;t joining the game with us &#8212; she was going shopping while we enjoyed America&#8217;s pastime. Unfortunately, that also meant she took the van with her, which contained my jacket. (Upon hopping out, Gabe and I declared that it was warm enough to go without jackets &#8212; Angie and Mark were far wiser, and Neall had a heavy shirt.)<br />
Safeco Field, although new and (assumedly) state-of-the-art, was built in the tradition of the great baseball fields: Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, and Wrigley Field, and Comiskey Park. It&#8217;s also a dedicated baseball stadium &#8212; no other sports (or events, as near as I can tell) occupy the space. The field is grass, and the stands are open to the wind &#8212; only the roof rolls shut to block out the rain (important on the West Coast).<br />
Our seats were at first base, about 20 rows up. Aside from the overhang of the upper deck which blocked the view of some of the flies, they were great seats. We were also one row away from the promenade, where we could find virtually any snack food imaginable, including the ubiquitous hot dogs, but also garlic fries, fish and chips, clam chowder, hamburgers, pizza &#8230; and all by local companies, no McDonald&#8217;s or Versa Foods here.<br />
This was Game 2 in a series between the Mariners and the Blue Jays. The last time I&#8217;d seen a Blue Jays game was about 10 years ago in Skydome, though it might have been 11 &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen so many, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. Almost all of my Jays games had been courtesy of a family friend, Mr. Gairdner, who offered us his season tickets from time to time. I had forgotten in those years just how much fun professional baseball really is.<br />
Well, when you&#8217;re not freezing to death.<br />
I made one major mistake. I left my jacket in the car. I should have been smart and brought it with me. But no, I thought I was fine. Stupid me. I forgot that I was on the West Coast, where the humidity is much higher. I&#8217;m beginning to realize that until the temperature rises into the low 20s (Celsius, of course), it will always be cold for me in the more humid regions of the world. Living in Calgary has dried me out, and my immunity to the cold seems to have waned. I can hack -20 degree weather here quite easily. But minus six in Toronto was brutal at Christmas (I wasn&#8217;t even phased by -20 when I used to live in Ontario), and I was finding that even 13 degrees in Seattle was cold, especially with the wind. I chose to put up with the chilliness, rather than fork out the money for a Mariner&#8217;s jacket&#8230;<br />
The opening ceremonies were a different spin on what I remember from Toronto. Like the Hitmen games I&#8217;d seen last month, Major League Baseball now has games to entertain viewers &#8212; kids&#8217; home run derbies, and pitching contests. Personally, I think it cheapens the game, reducing the game to almost something of a sideshow.<br />
What impressed me was the singing of the national anthems. They brought in the Walla Walla High School Chamber Group. Although American, they sung perhaps the most amazing rendition of &#8220;O Canada&#8221; I&#8217;ve ever heard. It actually brought a tear to my eye. Mark was the only one of us who sang along &#8230; I usually don&#8217;t because my singing usually sends people running for dear life. The choir&#8217;s rendition of &#8220;Star Spangled Banner&#8221; was, sadly, typically American &#8212; seldom sung the way it was written. There are times I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m Canadian, where our national anthem is sung only two ways, English and French, and is always the same length.<br />
I&#8217;m not entire sure how many Canadians were there that day (we saw a few Canadian flags floating around), but there was a fair bit of cheering when Toronto took the field. Understandably, though, the cheering was much louder when Seattle came out &#8230; especially for their right fielder, Ichiro Suzuki. He&#8217;s one of two Japanese players with Seattle, and both are immensely popular, the other being closing pitcher Kazuhiro Sasaki. They&#8217;re good players &#8212; Ichiro hits a mean ball, and Kazuhiro throws a pretty vicious pitch.<br />
The game was tight &#8212; a couple home runs, some really great fielding, good solid hits, and the odd error made for some really good drama. I remembered watching the World Series back in 1992 in the townhouse I shared with roommates Roger, Ed, and Brian, screaming at the mistakes and groaning every hit the Braves made during the sixth game of the World Series, only to later wake the dead (along with everyone else in the complex) as the Jays went onto victory.<br />
Different team, different city, different opponents, and not even a championship on the line &#8230; the emotions were all the same. We all huffed at missed chances, cheered for the really good plays, and whined when the Mariners scored. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t a blow-out for either team &#8212; a good solid race clear through. The only way I would&#8217;ve enjoyed it more was if I&#8217;d been warmer.<br />
By the seventh inning, I was chilled to the bone. Neall noticed my sad plight, and literally gave me the shirt off his back. I knew the four of them were laughing me &#8212; admittedly, I was laughing at myself. Once upon a time, the cold didn&#8217;t bother me. I hate to admit it, but I&#8217;m a damp weather wimp now.<br />
The game ended on a down note &#8212; the Jays lost 7-5. After watching the roof close (which is a bit of spectacle in itself), we worked our way out and tried to meet up with Carol. The only problem was navigating through the 42,000 other fans who were doing roughly the same thing. Fortunately for us, Carol and I were both equipped with cell phones, so after a few conversations, we managed to all meet up.<br />
Departing the port, we headed into the downtown area, to Pioneer Square, and the Elliott Bay Book Store. This is perhaps the coolest book store I&#8217;ve ever been in. It&#8217;s huge &#8212; about the size of a chapters, only with more books. And it&#8217;s in (what I would assume to be) a heritage building. Being from Alberta, buying books in the States doesn&#8217;t really save me any money, so I just took the time to look around.<br />
Hunger soon had it&#8217;s call, though, and we were off in search of food. Unfortunately, no-one was particularly helpful in deciding where to go. We drove somewhat aimlessly around Seattle trying to find a place to eat, all the while asking &#8220;where are we going?&#8221;. We ultimately ended up at 13 Coins, a restaurant Mark had learned about in a travel guide.<br />
One day, I will finally obtain proof that the restaurants that appear in travel guides are only there because the restaurateurs bribed the author. Of all the so-called great places to eat that I&#8217;ve read about, only a couple were actually good. Unfortunately, 13 Coins wasn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
This place had decor that even Elvis would be terrified of. I was convinced that someone had loved the 70s so much, that they refused to redecorate with anything less awful. But when you take into account the &#8220;cheese factor&#8221; of such a place, it&#8217;s kind of interesting &#8230; for a novelty, that is.<br />
The quality of the food, so I&#8217;ve found, usually matches the decor. And believe me, it was pretty darn hard to find something on the menu that I wanted to eat. (Mind you, it was mostly because I was still full from the hot dog, chicken strips and fries, and the tepidly bland hot chocolate I&#8217;d had at Safeco Field.) I settled on a Philadelphia Steak Sandwich, which turned out to be a small piece of beef on garlic toast. Not great, but I&#8217;ve had worse.<br />
The trip back to Vancouver was marked with the showing of &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;. (Note to self: Make sure there is a video system in my next car.) Despite it being one of my favourite movies, I still fell asleep for about an hour or so. The movie ended just as we were pulling into Richmond, and dropped off Gabe. The next stop was at Radical, where I was going to meet up with Greg. I grabbed all my things (I&#8217;d brought my bag with me), and said goodbye. I called up to Greg, who came down to let me in. A quick thumbs-up sent Mark, Carol, Neall, and Angie off into the night.<br />
Greg, along with several of his team members, were hard at work on their game. It was going to be a late night, which Greg immediately started apologizing for. But frankly, I didn&#8217;t mind hanging out at Radical. I always liked hanging out there, even when I was the only one. It was a fun company, and near as I can tell, still is. Greg and I struck a happy medium &#8212; while he coded, I would test.<br />
So for the next four hours, I played a game that no-one will see for about four months. And no, I can&#8217;t tell you anything about it. I will say this &#8212; it&#8217;s a LOT of fun. Greg, like most of the programmers I worked with at Radical, are wizards &#8212; they can churn out some of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever seen or played. This game was no different. Although it won&#8217;t set any new standards for graphics, the game play is outstanding &#8230; definitely better than another game that will ultimately be compared so when it finally ships.<br />
The game doesn&#8217;t wrap up until early August. So why the crunch in early May? The Electronic Entertainment Exposition, known as E3, which is in mid-May. This is when all the Christmas games first appear. This is when game companies try to outdo each other. This is *the* event if you work in the video game industry. And this game is debuting there. Like any good video game project, they were under the gun to tweak enough stuff to make it play really well, and make a lot of people very jealous.<br />
Personally, I think they nailed it perfectly.<br />
Somewhere around 2am, Greg and I headed out for his place in very east Burnaby. We stayed up for a short while and talked, but we were both so tired, we opted for sleep instead.<br />
Sunday morning came around 9:30. I was still exhausted from the day before, but rose and showered and prepared for the day. Not there was much to prepare for &#8212; there wasn&#8217;t much on the agenda. A quick breakfast at IHOP, and we went back into the office. We weren&#8217;t there too long, as I had to go to the airport. This time, Greg drove me out, which I was thankful for (the transit strike makes getting a taxi outside of the airport rather difficult). I bid him farewell, he drove back to work, and I checked in for the flight.<br />
I slept on the way back, though not intentionally. I was utterly wiped. I hadn&#8217;t been so active in so long that my body simply wasn&#8217;t ready for it. I vaguely remember something about 35,000 feet, and something about returning my seat to its original upright position. Next thing I knew, I was hopping the bus home. And as we all know, home is where the heart, bed, and 50&#8243; TV are. This was where I was determined to spend the next several hours &#8230; sleeping.<br />
Unfortunately, it seemed that my vacation would be cut short. Crisis at Critical Mass &#8212; the site I was working on had basically fallen apart in my absence. Somehow, I&#8217;d become the centre of communications, and without me around, everything came to a halt. I didn&#8217;t get home until 1:30am.<br />
I look back at my weekend, and I actually have to force myself to believe I was actually there. With all the apprehension I had towards going back, I now find it hard to believe I did it. But I know I did, and I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad I saw my friends again (despite the fact that I feel like a twit for forgetting names). I&#8217;m glad I saw a Blue Jays game (even though they lost). But most of all, I&#8217;m glad that my past is now just that &#8212; behind me. All that&#8217;s left is the possibility of the future.<br />
Vancouver is a destination for me. Not to live, but certainly to visit. I will see sights I never saw, I will do things I never got the chance to do. I&#8217;m content that no matter what I see and do, it was because of me (with a lot of support from my family and friends) that I&#8217;m capable of doing it. And so long as I know people in Vancouver, or at least have an inkling of a reason, I will go there, and I will enjoy myself each and every minute.<br />
At least when it isn&#8217;t raining.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Life is abdunant with difficult experiences. Some come from education, some from your job, some from a close relationship with a potential life partner. But there are few experiences that are as hard as saying goodbye to good friends.<br />
Critical Mass is opening an office in Toronto. Its first day of business is Monday the 19th. We&#8217;re staffing it with some people who were hired and brought here, and with some who were here and want to go back east. Tonight, Critical Mass said a fond farewell to 23 of its own, as they prepare to embark on a journey to the centre of the Universe (otherwise known as Toronto) and open our new office.<br />
It could have been more emotional, I suppose, but that&#8217;s probably why there was free alcohol, to keep us placated. (In retrospect, not a bad thing.) But it still didn&#8217;t dull the pain of seeing people leave. I know most of the people who are going, either by working with them or being on the same team.<br />
Today I said goodbye to three good friends: Dave, Mike, and Jen.<br />
Dave was the one who interviewed me when I first walked through Critical Mass&#8217; doors just over a year ago. I remember the interview well, thinking I was in a lot of trouble because I couldn&#8217;t figure out what he wanted. Dave&#8217;s got a good poker face. It wasn&#8217;t until we struck upon movies that he seemed to lighten up. Not a month later, I was seated a desk away from Dave, and since then have been fortunate to know Dave quite well. We spent several very long days and nights during the summer working on our respective projects, often staying until the wee hours of the morning alternating between coding and acting goofy.<br />
Mike was also in my department, but because he sat in a different area, I really didn&#8217;t get to know him until a couple of months after I got here. Mike&#8217;s wit and passion for independent films was what set him apart from most people, as did his fascination (some call it obsession) with strange video games like &#8220;Samba De Amigo&#8221;.<br />
I first met Jen on the night before we were to deliver a pitch for a potential client. She and Chris had been engaged in heavy conversation when I arrived. We found that she shared the same birthday as Chris and I, which created some sort of strange bond between the three of us. Jen and I have since seen a couple of Tuesday night movies (&#8220;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#8221; and &#8220;Chocolat&#8221;) and had a few deep conversations of our own. I&#8217;ve known Jen for only just over four months, but it feels like it&#8217;s been much longer.<br />
I&#8217;ve been preparing for this day for a long time, but it seems so surreal to have it finally arrive. Not an hour ago, I watched Dave and Mike drive away into the night, knowing that there would be no more game nights with them, no more breakfasts or lunches, no more movies. Soon, I will say goodbye to Jen, and she, too, will disappear into the night. No more deep conversations over pints of Guinness about movies or strange things that have happened in our lives.<br />
They&#8217;re still a part of Critical Mass, but they might as well have moved to the other side of the world for all it really matters. They&#8217;re not here.<br />
Last night, I went out with Dave for his second-to-last night in Calgary. I drank more than I would normally, probably to dull the pain. Tonight, I found myself doing the same again. Were I more sober, I would realise how much it hurts. I did my best to laugh and joke as Dave and Mike drove away, all the time feeling my insides twisting up into a single tight knot.<br />
Tomorrow, I will come to work, and see three empty desks where my friends used to sit. I&#8217;ll see their ghosts for days, maybe even weeks to come. Sure, there will always be email, but it&#8217;s never quite the same as being with them. This I know from experience.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say goodbye to good friends.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s been one of those years. I really hope I don&#8217;t have to go through another one like that again. Clichéd though it be, it was a year for rediscovery &#8212; mostly of myself. I lost my self-identity in Vancouver, allowing myself to be overwhelmed by another. It takes a while to rebuild that sort of thing. It&#8217;s not done yet, but having gone through that I know now what to avoid should I ever be so stupid as to get myself into that situation again&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a weird week. Imagine trying to do &#8220;business as usual&#8221; knowing full well that in a week you&#8217;d be working out of a new office. That&#8217;s pretty much what last week was like.<br />
Critical Mass is big. As of next week, we&#8217;ll have 252 people &#8230; in Calgary. That doesn&#8217;t count the Chicago, New York, or Stockholm offices. (We&#8217;ll be even bigger once we open the Toronto office. That actually scares some people.) We ran out of space in our old building a long time ago &#8212; it was almost to the point where we would have to start stacking desks just to get everyone in.<br />
So many moons ago, our Operations Manager starting hunting for a new space. That&#8217;s not easy in Calgary &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of office space around, but it&#8217;s either occupied or WAY too dull for a &#8220;leading edge interactive marketing agency&#8221;, which I think is how we describe ourselves.<br />
The search went on for months before (somehow) we started negotiations with Mogens Smed, one of the leading interior designers for office spaces. Funky furniture, comfy chairs, and nothing that would be considered really &#8220;corporate&#8221;. It&#8217;s kinda like a step up from IKEA furniture, which is what we had. (Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with IKEA).<br />
Smed bought a building just north of the Stampede grounds that had been abandoned for many years. With Critical Mass providing direction (as we were to be the sole occupants), Smed transformed the old Pilkington Glass Company factory into the World Headquarters for Critical Mass.<br />
In six months.<br />
Frankly, I&#8217;m amazed they pulled it off. As Ted (our Chairman) remarked during today&#8217;s &#8220;tour&#8221;, it was an 18-month job done in a third of the time. But you wouldn&#8217;t know to look around. It&#8217;s a quality job. It&#8217;s also a bit getting used to &#8212; everything&#8217;s so &#8230; new. And unused. Kinda like a Star Trek episode&#8230;<br />
The trick, of course, was to get us from our old building and settled into our new building in as little time as possible. That was what happened during the weekend. With a significant amount of prep work by our administration staff, we packed and labelled every single last item in the office, right down to the spare paper clips, before Friday. On Friday morning, everyone came in, packed up their desks into plastic bins, wrapped up their computers, and left by about 9:30am. After that, it was all up to the movers.<br />
We came in around 2:00 in the afternoon on Sunday, on a directive from Ted, to unpack our bins and set up our desks. Aside from a few small things, everything arrived intact an unharmed. Even more shocking was when I got in this morning &#8212; except for our LDAP server, we were up and running. All the phones, the mail server, the Internet connection &#8212; everything. It was all up. Mind you, it wasn&#8217;t without its glitches, but when you consider that the office was moved in a weekend to a new location, and it all works, well &#8230; that&#8217;s a pretty amazing feat.<br />
We have a really interesting deal with Smed. They own the building, and all the furniture inside. We own the computers. We get a really cool office (for a lot less than we should), and Smed gets a really cool company to occupy the space. Smed gets to drag in companies like Coca-Cola to show them what a cool space looks like, and if we happen to pitch a website to them at the same time, well, that&#8217;s business.<br />
Hollywood scripts aren&#8217;t planned this well. (Especially this year&#8230;)<br />
With slightly over two weeks left before I duck out for Ontario for Christmas, the next couple of weeks are going to be really hectic.<br />
But at least I can go insane in a cool building&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Things have been pretty quiet since the summer &#8212; not a lot of activity, not a heck of a lot to report. But this is a habit I&#8217;ve gotta keep up, if for nothing else so that I&#8217;ll be in practice if/when this Japan thing pans out. Although admittedly, I&#8217;ll probably have much more to talk about then.<br />
Our weekend more-or-less began at 12:45pm on Thursday. That was when we heard: &#8220;Anyone who can hear this, get your butts over the Danish Community Hall now!&#8221; That was the call for our &#8220;Town Hall Meeting&#8221;, a gathering of the Calgary office in one place. Once upon a time (before I started), we could actually congregate in one place in the office. Doesn&#8217;t happen anymore &#8212; we have to go across the street to the DCH so we can hear the speeches.<br />
We hold these about every six months. It&#8217;s mostly so everyone can have an inkling of what&#8217;s going on. (We&#8217;ve got a lot of people spread across a lot of projects &#8212; there&#8217;s no way for everyone to know everything. That&#8217;s not to say, of course, that I don&#8217;t try.) All 250-odd people crammed into the Valhalla Hall for four hours of cheesy speeches, reviews on our projects, really dull organizational ponderings, and an auction.<br />
Yes, an auction. Ted, one of our founders and the company Chairman (Chairperson, whatever!) and the other members of the senior management auctioned off a gourmet meal for 12 people. It&#8217;s a fundraiser (believe it or not) for charity. They wine and dine you, you fork out a lot of money, which when combined with money from Critical Mass (the company), goes towards sending underprivileged to camp in Westbank. (Ted&#8217;s got a thing for Westbank&#8230;) Many people got together in groups of 12 to try and bid for the prize. I say &#8220;try&#8221; because within only a minute or so, the price surpassed anything we grunts could afford &#8212; it was a battle between our CTO and our Director of Project Management. When the dust settled, Ted said the dinner was now for 24, and took both groups. All told, about $22,000 is going to kids. Not bad for five minutes&#8217; work, eh?<br />
The meeting over, we were instructed to attending a post-Town Hall reception at Ceili&#8217;s (it&#8217;s Gaelic, so you pronounce it &#8220;Cayley&#8217;s&#8221;) &#8212; a pub a couple blocks away. By 8pm, the only sober person was Chris. Everyone else was quite inebriated. Luckily for us, Ted had told us we didn&#8217;t have to come in at our regular time (8am) the following morning. This was good. Most people didn&#8217;t show up until 10am. A few didn&#8217;t straggle in until 2pm &#8212; they didn&#8217;t look so good.<br />
Friday night, we met with up with Therese and Stuart (who were somewhat fresh from their trip to Vancouver &#8212; they must&#8217;ve really enjoyed themselves, we&#8217;ve heard much of their escapades; I&#8217;ve listened intently, and been able to picture exactly where they&#8217;ve been and how it looks &#8212; I have to admit that I still miss it) to see &#8220;Pay It Forward&#8221;, one of the better movies this year. Haley Joel Osmet (the kid) is one of these once-in-a-lifetime wunderkinds who either go onto huge success or burn out trying. I sincerely hope it&#8217;s more the former than the latter&#8230;<br />
On Saturday, I had the pleasure of keeping an eye on my little cousin, Jen. Hmm&#8230; &#8220;Little&#8221; isn&#8217;t a good word. Let&#8217;s go with &#8220;younger&#8221;. Jen&#8217;s 16 years younger than me. She&#8217;s less than an inch shorter than me. Notice a problem with this? For some reason that I&#8217;ll never understand, the Western side of my family seems to have mutant children that grow to huge heights. Must be the water.<br />
Deciding that I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having her trounce all over me on her N64 all evening, I suggested that I take her to a movie. At first, she wasn&#8217;t too keen, but when I suggested playing video games before the movie, she ran for her coat. The movie was &#8220;The Little Vampire&#8221;. It&#8217;s a cute little movie, though I wasn&#8217;t sure how Jen would respond to it. She&#8217;s at that &#8220;pre-teenager&#8221; stage where kid things are no longer cool, but I&#8217;m not comfortable with dragging her into most of the other movies currently out (although she&#8217;s seen &#8220;Meet The Parents&#8221; and loved it).<br />
We played &#8220;Gauntlet&#8221; (the new version &#8212; Jen&#8217;s too young to remember the original) for two hours. Straight. We hurt afterwards&#8230;<br />
Sunday started with dim sum. It&#8217;s almost a ritual for Chris and I &#8212; one more week, and we&#8217;ll have a set pattern that&#8217;ll be hard to break. However, we&#8217;ve run into one itty bitty problem with it &#8212; the line-up seems to be getting bigger every week. Dunno why &#8212; it was fine up until two weeks ago. We need to start going earlier. Stuart and Therese were a bit surprised at the line-up, too, and they&#8217;ve been to Silver Dragon far more often than Chris and I.<br />
The best part about weekends is having no plans. So when Therese suggested we go &#8220;window shopping&#8221;, we eagerly piled into Stuart and Therese&#8217;s new Volkswagen Jetta (complete with possibly the best-sounding stereo I&#8217;ve ever heard in a car) and drove south to Chinook Mall. There, Chris proceeded to attempt to buy something from every store. Of course, that&#8217;s an exaggeration &#8212; he&#8217;s not *that* bad&#8230; Therese and I somehow managed to make it out of the mall unscathed, financially-speaking, that is. Chris won the award for most stuff, and for most unusual &#8212; a replica of the old vinyl airline bags of the &#8217;60s. Why? Dunno. It&#8217;s a Chris thing&#8230;<br />
Speaking of airlines, Chris and I will be returning to the wilds of Ontario for Christmas this year, on (or around) the 20th. Tickets have been booked and paid for, so there&#8217;s no holding us back. Unless somebody chains the plane to the ground, that is&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is a hard-working company. And Ted (our founder and corporate Chairman) knows it. To &#8220;thank&#8221; us for all the grief he puts us through, he closes (more or less) the office for two days, packs us off to some remote part of the country, and gets us all horribly drunk &#8212; and he pays for everything. It might be good to be king, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to be a peasant every once in a while.<br />
Critical Mass starts planning &#8220;The Trip&#8221;, as it&#8217;s usually referred to, about four months early. It&#8217;s a fairly involved excursion, and when you consider the attendance (at least this year) is about 300 people, there&#8217;s a fair bit of coordination involved. We have two people who work on it nearly full-time, in addition to their regular jobs. And then there&#8217;s a team of about 10 people (representing the various departments in the company) who help in the decision making for things such as, well, the beer labels.<br />
Yes, beer labels. This was something I participated in. We had a beer label competition. If you buy enough beer from the Big Rock Brewery here in Calgary, you can make your own special labels for the event. When I first heard about the opportunity to see if I could out-design the Design department, I leapt a the chance. I came in second. Behind Adrian. A guy who works in Design. Oh well, maybe next year.<br />
We arrived at Critical Mass on Thursday morning with bags in hand, ready for the nine-odd hour trip to Westbank, British Columbia. (For those of you who&#8217;ve never heard of Westbank, it&#8217;s a little south of Kelowna, on the east side of Lake Okanagan.) Luckily, we were not taking school busses (I can only imaging the agony of sitting in those for more than three hours at a time) &#8212; were taking Greyhound.<br />
The busses started arriving around 8:00am. We were told they would arrive at 7:30am. This was a tactic to make sure we all were there on time. As it stands, the fourth (and last) bus didn&#8217;t arrive until nearly 8:45, and we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 9:00 (despite the threatened 8:30 departure time). Again, all of this was planned with an iota of experience &#8212; I assume they had problems last year, and figured it would be worse this time around.<br />
Luckily, our Greyhound busses came equipped with all the modern conveniences: Reclining seats, air conditioning, and a VCR with two TVs. That meant movies. And what better movies to travel with than the Indiana Jones trilogy? Well, if you&#8217;re Mike (on of my co-workers, and a huge fan of independent films), it also includes &#8220;Waiting for Guffman&#8221;. Mike, it seems, was the only one really interested in it. I would have preferred to see &#8220;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&#8221; instead, which was bumped when Mike beat us to the VCR.<br />
We made three stops along the way &#8212; a quick one at some rest stop, one at Golden for lunch, and a third one in some rinky-dink place north of Vernon so all the smokers on the busses wouldn&#8217;t shake it apart from nic-fits. Every time we had a stop, Pat (whom we labelled &#8220;Bus Masta P&#8221; &#8212; he was in charge of all the busses) got stressed out trying to keep everyone on schedule by getting them back on. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll willingly do that again next year.<br />
We arrived at the Cove Resort around 5:30pm PDT. Now, before you get all &#8220;oooh, a resort!&#8221;, this is at best a word that would describe the long-term plans. There&#8217;s no shuffleboard, no sailboats, no beach &#8212; not even anything remotely resembling a restaurant. It&#8217;s an old farm converted to 26 cabins and a small motel-like building. My cabin, in fact, used to be the farm house. Even all those cabins couldn&#8217;t house our bulk &#8212; we needed the large field to accommodate an additional 20 or so tents.<br />
There were no real plans that evening, aside from getting settled (which took a while &#8212; we had a lot of stuff to unload from the busses), eat (which we did, around 7:00 that evening), drink (which we did in abundance), and relax (which came after the aforementioned drinking). Many of us congregated at Cabin #6, home of the Conners Brothers and Colin &#8212; a perfect recipe for trouble, especially when four tenters were regularly crashing on the cabin floor rather than sleeping outside. Cabin #6 became legend by the following morning.<br />
I didn&#8217;t rise until nearly 1pm, opting to catch up on a lot of sleep. The day was warm and sunny, and people were milling about. I headed to the main tent, where I hoped lunch was being served (I didn&#8217;t really know what time it was, I didn&#8217;t know for most of the weekend). I was in luck &#8212; lunch was slowly beginning to end, and snatching up a meal was as simple as walking up to the table and taking whatever I wanted.<br />
The day was slow and lazy &#8212; the way a day should be. Others went off in search of amenities such as McDonald&#8217;s and Starbucks. I went off in search of things I could watch. I opted not to actually participate in anything, trying not to do anything physically active at all. (This was a conscious decision &#8230; it came right after I realized I&#8217;d forgotten my swimsuit.) There were plenty of things for me to watch &#8212; people were playing sports all over the place, including horseshoes, bocce, volleyball, soccer, and touch football.<br />
The &#8220;major&#8221; event of the day was the wakeboarding demonstration. Ted (who lives barely five minutes from the Resort) is basically a big kid, and is always looking for new toys and things to do. (This is why we also had a houseboat that would take us on short rides on the lake, and Ted took extreme pleasure in whipping people around in his new super-fast powerboat.) Ted hired professional wakeboarders (some of whom had placed as high as fifth in Wakestock, the wakeboarding championships) to not only show us what they could do, but teach others to do it as well.<br />
The demonstration sucked.<br />
Okay, to be fair, they were good. The only problem was that their best demonstration was nearly half a kilometre away, and nearly impossible to see. Our cheering could be best described as &#8220;reserved&#8221;.<br />
Hamburgers were on the menu that night. We were lucky &#8212; our meals were provided by a catering company (who did an excellent job). Last year, those who went on the trip were preparing their own meals. Relaxation is much easier when you only need to show up and eat.<br />
Entertainment for the first night in Westbank was courtesy of several &#8220;amateur&#8221; (though they certainly sound professional) DJs who work in various parts of the company. The second night&#8217;s entertainment was also musical, but certainly more &#8230; interesting.<br />
Karaoke.<br />
Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;You did karaoke??&#8221; Well, *I* didn&#8217;t do karaoke, but just about everyone else did. Why didn&#8217;t I? Aside from a terminal case of stage fright, I also happen to be extremely self-conscious about my inability to sing. Hey, when you take a jab at yourself in front of your friends (such as &#8220;I sing horribly&#8221;), and they don&#8217;t respond the way friends normally do (such as &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not *that* bad&#8221;), you know you suck.<br />
Mike (the guy with the independent film fetish) was anxious to get on stage and show his stuff. (Mike&#8217;s a little weird.) He wasn&#8217;t the first on stage. That was Geoff Mackenzie.<br />
Geoff&#8217;s a character. (Must be in the name.) He was dressed in jeans (pants and jacket), a somewhat-loud cowboy-like shirt, and a corduroy cowboy hat. The first song of the evening was &#8220;Stand By Your Man&#8221;. And no, he didn&#8217;t change the lyrics one bit. Geoff&#8217;s performance (with heavy doses of ham) set the tone for the evening, and it went downhill from there.<br />
Chris (my roommate, friend, and fellow troublemaker) was up shortly after Geoff. Chris erupted onto the stage with an opening that went somewhat like this: &#8220;Aight, they didn&#8217;t have any NWA, so instead, this one goes out to all my Critical Mass niggaz and all my Critical Mass shortys. Let&#8217;s roll up on this motherf***er&#8230;&#8221; He did Lionel Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Easy (Like Sunday Morning)&#8221;. With audience participation. Shannon, another of my co-workers who knows Chris, was sitting on the balcony outside his motel room (there was a motel-like building that housed another six rooms of people) was duly impressed with Chris&#8217; performance. It led to a return to the stage for a duet with Rob (who&#8217;s in Design, I think) to do &#8220;Ebony and Ivory&#8221;. Rob and Chris lapped up the audience&#8217;s appreciation.<br />
During a needed sprint back to my cabin (bathroom break), I missed the opening of one of the headlining acts for the night: Ted and Dewi. They brought their own music (they figured the karaoke company wouldn&#8217;t have the song they wanted to do) &#8212; Backstreet Boys&#8217; &#8220;Larger Than Life&#8221;. Only they had help &#8212; four others who did the now-famous chair dance while Ted and Dewi crooned. (I should point out that this was not only set up well in advance, but the chair dancers practiced their moves before strutting their stuff in public.) The audience might as well have been from an actual Backstreet Boys concert from the amount of screaming and cheering&#8230;<br />
Geoff came back for another round of fun, performing that Johnny Cash classic, &#8220;Ring of Fire&#8221;. You&#8217;d never think so many people would be so into karaoke. I guess it all depends on who&#8217;s up performing. I think I have a whole new appreciation for that brand of entertainment. For example, we staged the first ever Tiffany mosh pit when two singing souls (Steve and Andrew) did their rendition of &#8220;I Think We&#8217;re Alone Now&#8221;. It was a sign of things to come.<br />
Anyway, Geoff stole the show again, and then managed to get everyone in the tent to break a few hundred noise by-laws by screaming at the top of their lungs. I think my Aunt Alaine and Uncle David (who live on the other side of the lake) could probably have heard us that evening. Luckily, the cops never showed up.<br />
The fight for the limelight also included Shawn Conners (one of the Conners Brothers). Shawn is about as perfect a specimen of a (pardon the language) &#8220;shit disturber&#8221; as I have ever met. He is also an artiste (note the extra &#8216;e&#8217;) and the biggest honey-glazed ham I have ever had the pleasure to have known. He and Colin did a great version of Milli Vanilli&#8217;s &#8220;Blame It On The Rain&#8221;. But Shawn wasn&#8217;t content with a simple singing version &#8212; he had to go that one step further and dump a bottle of water on himself (very much like in &#8220;Flashdance&#8221; &#8212; I still think they should have been doing &#8220;What A Feeling&#8221;) while striking an overly-dramatic pose.<br />
I made a hasty departure when Dave and his posse started singing &#8220;American Pie&#8221;. Keith&#8217;s a great singer, but it was a riot just waiting to happen. I hung out at the fire pit for a while, talking with some of the people who had fled the chaos, before retreating to Cabin #6 sometime around 1am, after the karaoke had broken down into a rave.<br />
I woke earlier the next morning and found my way to the big tent, where others were waiting for lunch. Breakfast had just ended, but I didn&#8217;t miss anything (muffins and fruit salad every morning were not enough of a reason for me to get up early). Lunch that day were smokies, and the tent was packed with hungry people waiting to eat.<br />
The afternoon was relaxed again. Some people slept, many others disappeared into town again, in search of amenities. Several went to see &#8220;X-Men&#8221; playing at the local cheapie theatre. I wandered around, talked with people, watched others try to wakeboard, sat around the campfire (which I think never went out from the moment it was lit), and watched others play cards.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t bored. Boredom comes when you want to do something, but are unable to determine what it is you want to do. I was trying to avoid activity. I was letting my mind turn to mush for a while. By purposely not thinking or doing anything, I was letting myself relax. I haven&#8217;t done it in a very long time, and it was hugely relaxing.<br />
One thing that required the use of my brain somewhat was reading the paper. Someone had left a copy of the Vancouver Sun on the table in my cabin, and I figured I&#8217;d see what was going down in the Lower Mainland. Aside from a massive sewer rupture spilling millions of litres of untreated sewage into Burrard Inlet, it seemed that not much had changed since I left &#8212; same political name-calling, same sports successes, and school was back in session (you know it&#8217;s a slow news day when&#8230;) It was very comforting to read a newspaper &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t read one since I was staying at my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s here in Calgary.<br />
The weather wasn&#8217;t cooperating one bit. While the previous day had been nice (although the night had been quite cold), we had bursts of rain for most of the day. Although right before dinner, we found ourselves gazing at the largest and most vivid double-rainbow I&#8217;ve ever seen. I&#8217;ve never seen a complete rainbow before, either &#8212; usually the top or either end is missing, but this one was a complete 180-degree arc. It was awe-inspiring. The joke that immediately followed was a query about how much Ted paid to have a rainbow appear before dinner.<br />
Our last supper in Westbank was steak and salmon, with baked potatoes and Caesar salad. Those of us who could, pigged out. Aside from the bones, it was great. (Although we apparently ran out of salmon, and I feel a little guilty for getting as much as I did. Only a little &#8212; it was Pacific salmon, after all.)<br />
Dessert was a special one that night. It was Ted&#8217;s birthday, and we had three cakes to spread around. Two of the cakes bore our Critical Mass propaganda logo, the third bore a relief sculpture of a caricature of Ted&#8217;s face. In icing. It was beautiful &#8230; and the artist (Mark Gervais) didn&#8217;t get fired for it.<br />
It was Caribbean night. This meant loud polyester shirts, shorts, and lots and lots and lots and lots of booze. (We went through between 9,000 and 13,000 pounds of booze in the weekend.) The Caribbean music (although good), lasted only long enough to get Ted (who was a little past plastered) to take a few swings at a piñata. Then the DJs got back into their swing, and the rave got going again. This was probably the most intense it had been since we got there, but most people realized that this was their last night to really let loose. And most of them did.<br />
Not being a dancer, nor finding anything else to do at that point, I found myself back at the fire pit again. Our group of six (comprising nearly every level and department in the company) engaged in hearty conversation. Our numbers soon swelled, when Ted arrived. (Wherever Ted goes, people go. It&#8217;s either an Einsteinian thing where people flow to the gravity well formed by Ted&#8217;s immense power, or they&#8217;re drawn like moths to candle flames. Either way, we soon had a lot of people.<br />
Ted was a little dismayed to find it was only 10:50. He had hoped it was 12:50. He wanted to go home, but thought it would be &#8230; well, wimpy of him to leave before 1am. Ted was wiped &#8212; the day had really taken a dent out of him, and he had two more hours to survive. Soon, there were about 50 people around the fire, and I&#8217;d lost my seat.<br />
Around midnight, the Rave Revolt began. First it started with Ted commenting that they&#8217;d played the same song for over three hours. Dan went over to &#8220;correct&#8221; the problem. He reported back (sans a change in music) saying Dewi protested, offering a change after &#8220;the first set&#8221;. Some of the more &#8220;senior&#8221; people (those over the age of 35) didn&#8217;t much like this answer. Ted decided it was time for action, and walked back towards the tent, muttering something about &#8220;Christmas bonuses&#8221;. A few minutes later, lyrics returned to the music, and the beat was noticeably different.<br />
It&#8217;s something that I think the older folk don&#8217;t quite understand. Rave music is meant to have a single beat that lasts for hours. It&#8217;s a challenge to keep the beat while changing the songs. The beat, although important, isn&#8217;t everything &#8212; melodies change, different layers of sound are woven in and out, even some lyrics thrown in for good measure. But it&#8217;s a sign of a skilled DJ who can make several hours of music sound like one song.<br />
By about 2:30 in the morning, there were only nine: Chris, myself, Ben, Adrian, Virgil, Mike (different Mike), Teak, Simone, and Marcie. We talked. All night. Our first major topic of conversations was 80s TV themes. Ben is the King of 80s TV. He knows the themes from virtually every TV show that aired from 1979 to 1991, except the really obscure ones like Automan, Manimal, Outlaws, and The Highwayman (bonus points to you if you a) even remember what they were, and double points if b) you can describe them.)<br />
Marcie and Simone left shortly before we finished that topic, saying &#8220;it&#8217;s time for bed&#8221;. Adrian suggested we do movie quotes &#8212; you give the quote, and the rest had to guess it. Chris and I had a decided advantage, having a) watched about a billion movies, and b) spent a great deal of time memorizing lines. For everyone who thought we were wasting our time, I offer you the fruits of our labour. Of course, Chris and I were always telling each other not to speak up, because we knew that the other would know the quote.<br />
Yeah, yeah, we act like we&#8217;re married. Like we haven&#8217;t heard that a thousand times before. It doesn&#8217;t help that we&#8217;ve been good friends for 13 years.<br />
Somewhere around 3:30am, Simone and Marcie returned to our circle, not having made it to bed. They&#8217;d been distracted by another social gathering elsewhere (assumedly not one as geeky as ours), but instead of going to bed when it broke up, they came back to us. (So I guess we&#8217;re not that geeky. No comments from the peanut gallery!)<br />
Somewhere around 4:00am or so, it began to rain. A lot. It was the sort of rain you knew would get you utterly soaked. And with the wind picking up, it was going to get us cold very quickly. We retreated to the big tent. We flipped on the lights, cranked up the heater, and returned to our little games. Ben bailed on us about 30 minutes later, leaving just the Group of Eight.<br />
When morning finally arrived, we started the process of getting ready to leave. Chris and I showered, packed, and hauled our stuff out to the Resort office porch, awaiting arrival of the busses. We then ate breakfast (muffins and fruit salad) and watched the sun come up. Figures that the day we leave good weather returns to Westbank.<br />
When the busses showed up, people started jumping on them. That started trouble. People (in general) are stupid. People don&#8217;t think about big pictures, what needs to be done, bla bla bla. That&#8217;s why we have visionaries. And anal retentive busy-bodies. (They&#8217;re often one-in-the-same, but that&#8217;s another long essay.) This is when I called upon the bus leaders to get their acts in gear, or we weren&#8217;t getting all the sound equipment, leftovers, and tents onto the busses.<br />
Chrissie (now the designated Bus Master), quickly knighted me and gave me the power to order others around. Holding everyone else back, we loaded our leftovers and whatnot onto the busses before letting everyone else suck up the rest of the space with their belongings. Packing took about 30 minutes.<br />
Chris was nowhere in sight. Having made mention to it earlier in the day (or later in the night before, take your choice), he had probably grabbed a seat with Marcie. (I would find out I was right after our first stop in Revelstoke.) I was seated behind Yasmin, one of our new people &#8212; she&#8217;s an Information Architect, and in front of Rich, one of our Project Managers. Along with most of the bus, we slept most of the way back to Calgary.<br />
We watched three movies: &#8220;Dumb and Dumber&#8221;, &#8220;Big Trouble In Little China&#8221;, and part of &#8220;True Lies&#8221;. When I was awake, I wasn&#8217;t watching the movies most of the time &#8212; I was watching the scenery. The day was so bright, and I wasn&#8217;t driving, that I got my first really good look at the sights to be seen in the mountains. There were a few times that I wished I could have stopped the bus just so I could look around.<br />
Arriving in Calgary, chaos ensued when we unloaded. But soon Chris and I were safe and sound at home. Overall, it was a great weekend, except for the 18 hours spent on the road. Those were a little more tedious. But I can think of worse things &#8212; 18 hours across the Prairies, for example.<br />
This morning, people were tired, foggy, semi-unconcious &#8212; basically everything you&#8217;d expect from such a weekend. Productivity will take a day or two to get back to normal. Whatever normal is&#8230;<br />
One last note: It was minus one this morning as I walked to work. The shorts are gone, the fleece is out, and the sandals are bare moments from being packed away. Summer is definitely over.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It all started when I received an email during my stay in Cincinnati. (This was a couple of weeks ago, obviously.) It was entitled &#8220;Kicking Horse Blazing Paddles&#8221;. It was a call for those interested in experiencing the adrenaline of whitewater rafting on the Kicking Horse River.<br />
I need not mention that I was interested&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;d never been whitewater rafting before, but I knew a few people who had, and they all loved it. So, naturally, my curiosity was piqued enough to be interested, and certainly the opportunity to try something more invigorating than a rollercoaster was enthralling. I had my named added to the list of other half-suicidal CMassers.<br />
As it turned out, there would only be six of us: Sean (who organized the trip), his brother Robin, Shannon, Sara, and Sara&#8217;s significant other, Brett. We had hoped for eight, at which point we could get a group discount, but we settled with our six and hoped for the best trip we could get under the circumstances.<br />
What about Chris? Well, Chris has a love/hate relationship with water. He doesn&#8217;t much like it outside of showers (although he&#8217;s taken up a healthy swimming regiment as of late). He also hates the cold. Really hates the cold. Loathes the cold. His response to my invitation to join us was:</p>
<blockquote><p>HAHAHAAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHH.<br />
Ha.<br />
Your [sic] a funny f&#8211;king lad&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We met early Saturday morning in the Critical Mass parking lot. Sean and his brother would drive in one car, Shannon and I in my car, and Sara and Brett in their SUV. Sean informed us that morning that we might in fact be late &#8212; there was the possibility that the drive could take upwards of four hours. Our trip was scheduled for noon. We were going to have to move fast.<br />
We left the parking lot, turned onto 10th Ave. SW, turned up 8th St., and then onto 6th Ave. Robin led us out to Sarcee Trail, which then took us to 16th Ave. (aka Trans Canada Highway), and then out of the city. For the next two hours, we stuck together like glue: Robin and Sean in front, Shannon and I in the middle, and Sara and Brett picking up the rear. This wasn&#8217;t particularly easy, since we hit speeds as high as 140 km/h making sure we got to our destination in time.<br />
Our destination was the Kootenay River Runners company, located on the Kicking Horse River about halfway between Field, BC and Golden, BC. This would be my first trip into British Columbia in almost four months. Admittedly, I was a little apprehensive at first, but I cast aside that irrational fear and plunged headlong&#8230;<br />
&#8230;into rain.<br />
Lots of it. Figures &#8212; I was going to BC, after all.<br />
It rained from almost the moment we left Calgary until just after we&#8217;d crossed the Kicking Horse Pass. So in a strange way, it wasn&#8217;t really raining *in* BC. Odd, isn&#8217;t it?<br />
The trip there was marked with Shannon and I discussing favourite movies, and me giving a brief history of Canadian development in the Rockies to Shannon. He didn&#8217;t know a lot about the area, and I guess I know more than I should. But he seemed interested, and (as most of you who know me will testify) I like to talk.<br />
We arrived at the Kootenay River Runner&#8217;s Whitewater Ranch at about 11:15 &#8212; way ahead of everyone else. We were listed as &#8220;early&#8221;. This gave us the chance to look around a little. The Whitewater Ranch is not as fancy as it sounds. Basically, it&#8217;s nothing more than a large shed (which houses most of the equipment and two washroom/change rooms), a couple of miscellaneous sheds, a half-completed barbecue shelter, and a large section of flood plain where the rafts waited to whisk us downriver.<br />
My first stop (after using the toilet) was to the river. The Kicking Horse River, like most of the rivers in the Rockies, is a glacial river. English translation: Frickin&#8217; cold. About one degree Celsius. Yes Virginia, it&#8217;s that cold. The river isn&#8217;t clear &#8212; it&#8217;s powder blue. This is from all the ice crystals suspended in the water. (This is also why glacial lakes, like Lake Louise, are blue.) And yes, it was very cold.<br />
People soon started arriving, and we opted to change into our rafting wear: Bathing suits and t-shirts. I gave up my sandals for my winter boots (basically over-grown shoes), as I wasn&#8217;t too keen on putting my bare feet into that river at any time. The guides (specifically one guy who we learned was called &#8220;Rhino&#8221; &#8212; he never told us why he was called that) and given the low-down on equipment.<br />
Our attire would not be limited to our swimsuits and t-shirts, for obvious reasons. (Namely, we&#8217;d develop hypothermia in less than a minute in these waters). Our first layer would be a swimsuit (or nothing at all), on top of which would be a wet suit. It wasn&#8217;t a full wetsuit, the top looked like neoprene overalls. On top of that would go a nylon fleece top, and a &#8220;spray jacket&#8221; on top of that (basically a slightly rubberized nylon shell). On top of that would be our life jacket. Our feet would have either neoprene &#8220;socks&#8221; or boots (or shoes, for those of us who couldn&#8217;t get the socks or boots). Lastly would be a helmet, so we wouldn&#8217;t knock ourselves silly on the rocks &#8230; or each other.<br />
Suiting up didn&#8217;t take too long, although some people had problems with the wetsuits, and one guy near me could not get the small fleece top over his extra large body. It was quite amusing to watch, though.<br />
After tossing our things onto one of two buses (we were only doing the Upper Kicking Horse portion of the river; roughly half of the group was also doing the Lower portion), we headed down to the river. There we got the safety speech. This is important. This is where you learn the basics of whitewater survival. Most of the time, you probably don&#8217;t need this speech &#8212; it&#8217;s for the worst-case scenarios.<br />
I&#8217;m glad we got it.<br />
The six of us ended up on raft #17. It&#8217;s a SOTAR (&#8220;State Of The Art Raft&#8221;), which basically means short of a nuclear blast, it&#8217;ll survive almost anything the river can offer. Our guide, Eric, was a nine-year veteran of river guiding, and had been guiding on this river for several years. He drove in from Vegreville (about five hours away) every weekend to send another group of hapless weekend warriors downriver to experience the thrill of freezing to death.<br />
Okay, it&#8217;s not *that* bad&#8230;<br />
Before boarding, we had to finish adjusting our lifejackets. Most people who use them (not all do) wear them pretty loosely. In most cases, this is probably fine. However, if you&#8217;re going whitewater rafting, particularly in such cold water, the lifejacket has to be tight &#8230; so tight it&#8217;s difficult to breathe. Why? Because if you fall out of the boat, they use the jacket to haul you back in. Eric had to tie Sara&#8217;s jacket on extra tight &#8212; she&#8217;s not a large person, and she was swimming inside the flotation device.<br />
We piled in, Shannon and I in the bow, Brett and Sara behind us, Eric in the middle, Sean and Robin behind him, and a recently-married elderly couple behind them (I only learned the man&#8217;s name, Neil). After a quick shove-off, we started our journey.<br />
Eric reiterated the safety speech, just to make sure we all understood what was going on. He then sent us through some simple drills. Forward and backward paddling, alternating sides paddling, diving to one side or the other &#8212; basic things to get us down river. The key was to paddle in sync, which meant Shannon and I would spend more time watching each other than the river. This would come back to haunt us.<br />
The first portion of the river was fairly tame &#8212; the odd ripple, a couple of nice currents, but nothing major. Then Eric sent us into (what I guess is) a Class II rapid. Shannon and I got soaked. It was cold. Really cold. But unlike jumping into cold water and starting to hyperventilate, it wasn&#8217;t paralysing. After a couple of moments, the water warmed a bit (as a wetsuit is supposed to) and it became less uncomfortable. Sara, who was sitting behind me, wasn&#8217;t quite as comfortable &#8212; she hadn&#8217;t done up the collar on her spray jacket and got a few cups of ice-cold water down the front.<br />
About 45 minutes after leaving Whitewater Ranch, we pulled over at the side of the river for lunch. By this point we were hucking our lifejackets to try and cool off. It was quite warm with those things on so tight. Waiting for us was hot coffee, hot water (with packets of hot chocolate powder), and lunch &#8230; though the guides had to help setting it all up. Soon, lunch was called and we dropped into line to get it.<br />
Lunch was pretty simple &#8212; make-your-own sandwiches, pickles, caesar salad, cantaloupe, and cookies. The website had said there would be a barbecue, but the shelter wasn&#8217;t complete, so we didn&#8217;t get to partake in that. Maybe next time&#8230;<br />
Lunch wasn&#8217;t particularly lavish, but it was filling enough to occupy the voids beginning to form in our stomachs. The group of 60 (or so) filled out the small clearing, munching away and discussing the first leg of the trip. Some of us knew what was in store for the second leg (we&#8217;d already been filled in by co-workers who&#8217;d done the trip the year before), and were excited to get back on the water.<br />
Especially since we were beginning to get cold. The lifejackets were great insulation from the cold, which was now beginning to set in. We couldn&#8217;t wait to get buckled back in and paddling to warm up.<br />
We shifted seats a bit when we headed back out. Shannon moved back to where Sean was sitting, I moved to where Shannon was sitting, and Sean moved to where I was sitting. Didn&#8217;t change much beyond that. I had to switch to the other side because my right arm was beginning to hurt a bit, and I wanted to give my left a chance.<br />
Soon we were off, back into smaller rapids, getting wet, and having fun. Only about five minutes out, we pulled off to the side again. Eric claimed he had to get out and &#8220;get his bearings&#8221;. I think this is code for the guides to figure out where the largest wave is to scare the bejeebers out of the beginners in the raft. We were about to enter Shotgun Alley.<br />
This is a section of the Kicking Horse where rocks have created the most intense rapids in the Upper section of the river. They max out at Class V (out of a maximum of Class X). We couldn&#8217;t see around the corner, and so had no idea what we were about to get into. Eric came back, saying he knew what he was going to do, so loaded us up, and away we went.<br />
Shotgun doesn&#8217;t look as bad as it actually is &#8230; at least from the river. Maybe from above it looks worse, but it&#8217;s hard to tell when your guide is yelling &#8220;Forward Paddle! Forward Paddle!&#8221; and you&#8217;re trying to match your strokes with the guy next to/in front of you.<br />
Suddenly, the powder blue water had turned an angry white. The boat lurched down and a massive wave crashed over the bow, knocking me square in the chest, and into the bottom of the raft. I struggled to get myself back out, but by the time I could, another wave hammered me again. Realizing that there was just no way I could get myself back up on the bow, I stayed inside the boat and hauled my paddle outside and kept paddling.<br />
The boat lurched down and up again, and more ice-cold water briefly blinded me. I flailed with the paddle as best I could, but it was seconds before I could see again. When I did see again, I was quickly wishing I wasn&#8217;t seeing what was about to happen.<br />
Rocks.<br />
Big ones.<br />
Eric, our guide, had either steered us too close to the side of the river (which happened to end in a sheer rock face), or my inability to paddle properly had reduced the power on my side of the boat, steering us in. Can&#8217;t say which, because I honestly don&#8217;t know. Either way, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; we still hit solid rock.<br />
Well, &#8220;hit&#8221; isn&#8217;t a good verb. &#8220;Ran aground&#8221; would be more proper, I guess. The rock was sloped, and what&#8217;s what we ran onto. I could feel the rock beneath me as we ran onto it &#8212; but we didn&#8217;t stay there for long. The river&#8217;s current dragged the raft sideways (with the bow acting as the pivot) and then off the rock and down river.<br />
Right into a large Class V rapid known as &#8220;The Terminator&#8221;.<br />
The raft rolled sharply up on it&#8217;s side (my side being the low side). The sudden upward swing catapulted Sean off the raft. Neil, the old guy at the stern, slid off. I, who was still trying to get back on the side to try and paddle, found the side now slipping out from under me. I, too, fell into the icy Kicking Horse River.<br />
We had been told at the safety orientation that when faced with a large rapid that the guide would yell &#8220;hold on&#8221; and we would grab a rope called the &#8220;centre line&#8221; that ran down the length of the raft. However, the call never came, and I didn&#8217;t see the rapid before it was too late. We&#8217;d also been told that in the event that you couldn&#8217;t grab the centre line, there was another rope that ran around the outside of the raft. This was called (and please pardon the language) the &#8220;Oh Shit!&#8221; line, so named because that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re usually yelling as you fall off.<br />
Luckily, my three years in sailing school had ingrained in me a survival instinct to stay with the boat. After my foot slipped out from under the centre line (I had tried to hike myself back in using that method), I reached for the OS line. Brett was immediately at the side of the raft to help me back in. As we were instructed during our training, I brought my paddle hand out of the water to hand them my paddle &#8230; only it wasn&#8217;t there. In the rush of falling out, I somehow had let go of it. Admittedly, it wasn&#8217;t the first thing on my mind at the time.<br />
Brett hauled me back in on the count of three, and we tried to resume a somewhat stable position. My immediate thought was &#8220;Where the heck is Sean?&#8221; &#8212; he wasn&#8217;t there (I didn&#8217;t know at the time that he&#8217;d been thrown clear off). I looked behind us and saw Sean floating some 100 metres away near the side of the river (the side with the sheer cliff).<br />
As we would find out later, Sean was trying to save his butt. He had managed to hang onto his paddle longer than me, but had turfed it in favour of saving himself. The raft behind us had tried to save him with one of the oars, but just as Sean reached for it, a rapid sucked him under. When he came back up, the raft was too far away, and he wasn&#8217;t getting any warmer. Sean saw a tree near the side, and swam for safety.<br />
Unfortunately, this meant that Sean was trapped at the side of a frigid raging river with no obvious way out. He&#8217;d also lost one of his neoprene boots in the chaos. (But he still had his contact lenses and his waterproof camera.) One of the rafts pulled to the same side of the river as Sean, and the guide went back to retrieve our fallen comrade-in-paddles. It was nearly 30 minutes before we saw them in the trees &#8212; we greeted Sean&#8217;s safe return with loud cat calls.<br />
A few minutes later, Sean was returned to our raft. Two paddles were passed forward, and we continued our trip. Sean and I stuck to the bow, unafraid of what would befall us (having already been befallen) and kept taking the waves. About 20 minutes later, we arrived at the end of our trip.<br />
Half of the group was continuing onto the Lower Kicking Horse, but had to leave the river and drive a bit further down. There&#8217;s a stretch between the Upper Kicking Horse and the Lower Kicking Horse that Eric described as &#8220;impassable&#8221;. He didn&#8217;t elaborate.<br />
Eric was called away to guide one of the Lower rafts, so bade us farewell, and darted away. We were left to peel our waterlogged clothes off, and put our dry clothes (which came in the bus) back on.<br />
We would find out that our raft wasn&#8217;t the only one to be taken out by the Terminator. Two other rafts from another company (which had entered the slot not long before us) had flipped. We got off lucky. Eric must have seen the spectacle, and opted not to tell us so that it wouldn&#8217;t get us worried. Luckily, we&#8217;d gone through a flip drill (not actual, but talked through it) in the event that happened.<br />
We changed, put all our wet things into huge piles, and boarded a bus to take us back to Whitewater Ranch. There we got back into our cars and made for the trip home. I had hoped to convince everyone to stop in Banff and go to the Irish pub there for dinner. I didn&#8217;t seem to get any initial takers, but Sean and Robin said they&#8217;d want to stop somewhere. The consensus was to drive back, and we&#8217;d stop somewhere along the way.<br />
Robin and Sean took the lead, and promptly started to disappear. I don&#8217;t know what their hurry was, but the rest of us had a heck of a time trying to keep up. I was cursing them for about an hour until I finally said &#8220;the heck with it&#8221;, and pulled ahead from Sara and Brett, hoping that they might be able to catch up later. Someone had to tell the other two to slow down.<br />
A couple of times I came close, but as soon as I got within honking distance, they pulled ahead and I couldn&#8217;t catch up. It wasn&#8217;t until we got back to a four-lane divided highway that I managed to catch them. Doing 150 km/h. In a 90 km/h zone. (If I&#8217;m *really* lucky, I won&#8217;t get a speeding ticket.)<br />
I chewed them out over the phone about 30 minutes later, after the cell phone signal was restored. Brett and Sara were nowhere in sight. I finally convinced Robin and Sean to pull over and wait. No sooner than we pulled over than Sara and Brett shot by at about 130 km/h. By the time we got back on the road, they were gone. We assume they pulled into Banff.<br />
We did not &#8212; I gave up my Irish stew and Guinness for a Wendy&#8217;s double hamburger and lemonade. Not exactly what I would call a consolation prize &#8230; more like a booby prize.<br />
When all&#8217;s said and done, it was a lot of fun. And I&#8217;d do it again. I just have to find seven half-suicidal people to go with me&#8230;</p>

		<p>Be it ever so humble &#8230; and a little messy &#8230; there&#8217;s no place like home.<br />
I missed yesterday&#8217;s log. Oops. Basically, the testing went well &#8212; the changes I made held and so far, things are looking good. That meant I could finally come home. I had to make some near last-minute changes (extending my stay at the Westin, and telling Northwest that I&#8217;d be leaving the following day), but otherwise all was fine.<br />
Actually, the last-minute changes were a little more in my favour &#8212; I had to book an earlier flight because the one I wanted was full. That was fine with me &#8212; I was more interested in coming home.<br />
This morning was mostly involved with updating the testing pages on the staging server, letting the team know which files were &#8220;approved&#8221; and which ones still needed work, and letting them know how to find me. Then it was off to the airport.<br />
If you ever go to Cincinnati Airport, make sure you bring a book. There&#8217;s nothing to look at there, the airport&#8217;s rather dull, and there&#8217;s no store once you pass security. Kinda annoying, if you ask me. Of course, I could have gone back through, but I really couldn&#8217;t be bothered.<br />
I was writing. Not this, but a report that I have to file for what I did. Our client&#8217;s still a little edgy with this so-called solution, so I need to prove it with a nice lengthy document that no-one will read. Fortunately, I&#8217;m good at being verbose. These logs are a testament to that, if nothing else.<br />
I love first class, although I have to admit I feel a little guilty taking it. I know what it&#8217;s like to be peering from steerage into the plushly-furnished curtained area. Unlimited drinks (which admittedly, I didn&#8217;t take advantage of), nicer meals, and big, comfy seats. Very nice.<br />
The flight from Cincinnati to Minneapolis was about an hour and a half, before I got dumped there to catch a connecting flight. During that time I took the opportunity to recharge my laptop&#8217;s battery. It&#8217;s a long life battery, but I wanted it to last the remaining leg of the journey. Northwest doesn&#8217;t show in-flight movies on such &#8220;short haul&#8221; flights, and I had nothing to read. I figured I&#8217;d entertain myself with a report.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to explain how much I enjoyed seeing the Prairies again. Land that stretches out forever, where it&#8217;s rare that cloud covers everything, where the buffalo used to roam, and the deer and the antelope are hunted for fun.<br />
We passed over Drumheller on our way in (I was amazed that I could recognize it from the air), and sailed smoothly into Calgary. Being the second from the front of the plane, I was the second one off. However, I was the first into Customs, which I blitzed right through. I completely bypassed baggage claim (carry-ons &#8212; it&#8217;s the only way to fly), and tore out the front door. I grabbed the first taxi, and was on my way home.<br />
I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;m much more adjusted to the western climate &#8212; it&#8217;s drier here, and I&#8217;m not a big fan of the oppressive humidity of the east. I was very happy not to be sweltering in the heat, and feeling a cool breeze for the first time in over a week.<br />
So if you&#8217;re ever living on the air in Cincinnati, don&#8217;t look for WKRP. It doesn&#8217;t exist. However, there is a WKRC.<br />
No kidding&#8230;</p>

		<p>Today was a good day. Finally.<br />
There&#8217;s nothing quite like the feeling of finally overcoming a problem that&#8217;s kept you up a night, sent you to perhaps the dullest city in mid-eastern America, had you eating mediocre food for a week, and put massive (albeit temporary) dents in your credit cards.<br />
It&#8217;s also good to know that I didn&#8217;t waste my weekend. The problems, not quite all, but most of them, are gone. All the work that I poured into this handy little laptop, not to mention some great backup from Calgary, solved our quandaries. The site&#8217;s working (mostly), and after tomorrow, we&#8217;ll be able to say that the site is solid, and I can finally go home.<br />
I met with John today. He&#8217;s our (Critical Mass&#8217;) account manager for our client. He&#8217;s not much older than me &#8212; I figure 30, tops. Probably from a business school. But he&#8217;s good with clients, and seems pretty good at fighting fires. He was here for his bi-monthly meeting with the client. He knows this city well.<br />
We had an interesting chat after work, over dinner at the Fifth and Vine, an eatery in the corner of the hotel. I gotta tell ya &#8212; he&#8217;s a great guy. He saw the client in pretty much the same way I do. Not to mention the contractors. I got a lot of positive feedback &#8212; he was glad I came. Although not the best candidate, I was good enough to convince some of the contractors that Critical Mass isn&#8217;t all pretty front-ends, and that we do know how to solve hard problems.<br />
Whether or not that keeps going is anyone&#8217;s guess&#8230;<br />
Tomorrow is coding and testing, and then I&#8217;m outta here on Thursday. With luck, I&#8217;ll be at work Friday morning.<br />
If I&#8217;m not, I might start looking for an apartment down here. It&#8217;ll certainly be cheaper than these hotels&#8230;</p>

		<p>I hate this city. And Memorial Day. The two of them combined? Well, let me tell you&#8230;<br />
I figured I&#8217;d stay in today and get some work done. Fine, no problem. Or so I thought. I got up later than I&#8217;d planned (probably because I&#8217;d stayed up so late), and so skipped breakfast (which I&#8217;ve done almost every day since I got here). I figured that I&#8217;d make it up with a nice sub.<br />
So I thought.<br />
In Canada, whenever we have a holiday, it&#8217;s a good excuse to go shopping. I&#8217;m not kidding &#8212; nearly everything that can be open is usually open. There are exceptions, but more often than not, you can at least find a restaurant, or a Subway, to get a meal.<br />
Not in Cincinnati.<br />
It&#8217;s locked down tighter than a drum. Even the bars are closed. What&#8217;s with that? Since when don&#8217;t Americans want to get drunk on a National Holiday? I thought that was a stereotype, for crying out loud!<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m annoyed.<br />
After wandering around downtown for about an hour, I found ONE open store or restaurant. Arby&#8217;s. I won&#8217;t touch Arby&#8217;s for all the roast beef in England. Can&#8217;t do it. Won&#8217;t do it. I hate Arby&#8217;s. I&#8217;ve eaten there twice, and hated it both times.<br />
So I figured I&#8217;d eat at one of the hotel&#8217;s restaurants. They closed at 1:50pm. They don&#8217;t open again until 5pm. What the heck kind of service is that??<br />
Oh yeah, there&#8217;s room service &#8230; if you want to pay US$15 for a lousy hamburger. For US$15, I can get a bottomless soft drink, a beer (a wheat beer, not some mega-swill), a huge gourmet hamburger (made to order) with cheese and bacon, fries, and a caesar salad. That&#8217;s at the Rock Bottom. I&#8217;d just as soon go there &#8230; but it&#8217;s closed.<br />
So I&#8217;m eating a Snickers bar and holding out until 6pm.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait to go home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today was my day off. It didn&#8217;t start that way &#8212; I was figuring on getting a lot of work in, but as I went out to scout for lunch, I decided that the day was nice enough that I would take a little walk. My logic says that if I take today off, I can work my keister off for the next 36 hours and still get the job done and get a good night&#8217;s sleep.<br />
In theory, at least.<br />
My goal was the Cincinnati Museum Center. It sounded like a really neat place to check out, and it was about the only thing in walking distance that I wanted to see.<br />
I walked up to 9th Street before heading west. Along the way, I passed examples of architecture from just about every period since the mid-to-late 1800s. Gerry would love this city.<br />
The weather was threatening rain, amidst bursts of sunshine. The forecast was for thunderstorms, but I never heard even so much as a slight rumble. Heck, it barely rained in the entire time I was walking about. Which was good, because I had neither an umbrella or a raincoat. Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have to go anywhere where I would be horribly out of place showing up soaked.<br />
According to the maps I&#8217;d read, all I had to do was cross I-75 on 9th Street, turn onto Gest Road, and walk up to Western Road. Unfortunately, maps seldom match reality. For starters, 9th Street doesn&#8217;t actually cross I-75 &#8212; 8th Street does. Although 8th Street doesn&#8217;t actually connect with the road that crosses I-75. Doesn&#8217;t make sense, does it? Well, considering the city has no movie theatres downtown and no stores open past 9pm (the Subway closes at 5pm on weekends!), it fits the pattern.<br />
When you get to the other side of the I-75, you&#8217;ll find that Gest doesn&#8217;t actually intersect with the road you&#8217;re walking on. It&#8217;s pseudo-parallel. And Western? I don&#8217;t think it meets Gest, either &#8230; although I could have just missed it without realizing.<br />
You can see the Cincinnati Museum Center even before you&#8217;ve reached the other side of the bridge. It&#8217;s that big. It took me about ten minutes to get there from the bridge, and when I got there, I realized that I had another five minutes of having to walk around so I could actually get in. (I came down towards the side, which has a road that goes under the parking lot.)<br />
The Cincinnati Museum Center is also known as Cincinnati Union Station. It was built in 1931 to handle the massive passenger rail traffic that used to run through the city. The station was huge. Its centre is a huge quarter sphere, with the flat side facing the front. The curved portion forms the massive rotunda of the complex. It&#8217;s a very dramatic art deco style. Gerry would love this building. So would Stuart, I think.<br />
I like the art deco style. I&#8217;d even go so far as to say I&#8217;m an art deco revivalist. Maybe it&#8217;s because I think the style is elegant, maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not concrete. Sometimes I think I long for the era that spawned art deco &#8212; the days when rail travel was king, when technology was the newest radio.<br />
Then again, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to write these logs as easily&#8230;<br />
The museum has four exhibits: The Cincinnati Museum in the south wing, the Natural History Museum in the north wing, the Children&#8217;s Museum in the &#8220;basement&#8221;, and an OmnIMAX theatre. Okay, &#8220;exhibits&#8221; is the wrong word &#8212; but museums sounds a little strange.<br />
Actually, there&#8217;s a fifth exhibit &#8212; the building itself. If you go on a weekend, you can get a free tour of Cincinnati Union Station &#8212; when it was railway station. They take you through the various sections that are still in the semi-original state. I caught a part of it when I was waiting in line for the OmnIMAX movie. More on that later.<br />
After purchasing my ticket, I went into the Cincinnati Museum. I figured that I could get through that before the movie at 4:00. The two wings used to be where vehicular traffic came through. It was a place for taxis and &#8220;motor coaches&#8221; (buses) to drop people off and pick people up. They arrived at the north wing (now the Natural History wing), drove under the main structure and picked people up on the south wing (now the Cincinnati Museum exhibit). The driveways are still visible, although now covered in grass.<br />
The first thing you notice when entering the Cincinnati Museum is a massive model of 1940s downtown Cincinnati. Some of the buildings are familiar &#8212; they still stand today. But many are gone, replaced by more modern (although not necessarily more attractive) buildings. One thing that&#8217;s very noticeable is the streetcars (taken out in the 1950s), and the railyard and warehousing district on the waterfront. Today, there are no rails down there, and the only buildings (aside from the highways) are Cinergy Field (home of the Cincinnati Reds) and a new stadium, currently under construction (the future home of the Cincinnati Reds).<br />
I spent about 15 minutes at the model, going through the interactive video, learning more about the city keeping my prisoner. It grew from the copious river traffic that flowed up and down the Ohio River. River travel was so important that the river boat captains wielded strong power over many decisions facing early Cincinnati.<br />
One of those decision was to build a bridge to neighbouring Newport, Kentucky. The captains didn&#8217;t like that idea &#8212; it would hinder their ability to monopolize freight and passenger traffic. But eventually it was built, although Cincinnati took three more years than its neighbour to grant permission. (Their excuse was potential loss of Cincinnati jobs and an increase in runaway slaves.)<br />
The bridge was designed by John A. Roebling, the same person who designed the Brooklyn Bridge. The John A. Roebling bridge, as it&#8217;s now known, is in fact the forefather of the Brooklyn Bridge. The design was later improved for its much more famous descendant.<br />
From there, I walked through a rather large exhibit about Cincinnati&#8217;s wartime efforts. They seem really proud of that. A little too proud, if you ask me. Of course, it might just be part of the Memorial Day festivities (there were vets all over the place).<br />
Then it was into ancient Cincinnati, starting from the arrival of Native Americans. One thing I learned early on was that Cincinnati, the order of officers for whom the city obtained its name, comes from Cincinnatus. Cincinnatus was a Roman general, who came from commoner stock. The officers of the Revolutionary War thought it was an appropriate name to give themselves (&#8220;Cincinnati&#8221; is Latin plural for &#8220;Cincinnatus&#8221;). So I guess in theory, a person from Cincinnati is a Cincinnatus. Hmm, I wonder&#8230;<br />
The exhibit was really quite fascinating. They covered the period of western encroachment into Ohio, from the first explorers, to the founding of Losantiville, the founding of Fort Washington, the Miami Purchase (don&#8217;t ask me what that was &#8212; the Americans seem obsessed with &#8220;purchases&#8221;, and the rising of the modern city that I can&#8217;t seem to escape.<br />
One of the neater parts of the exhibit was a 3/4 scale model of a steamboat, complete with part of original downtown Cincinnati. The exhibit stopped around the turn of the 20th century.<br />
By that time, I thought I should head up, so I wouldn&#8217;t miss the movie. I was about 40 minutes early, so I just camped out around the door. Soon, the tour of Cincinnati Union Station came by. At first, I didn&#8217;t know what it was, but I was offered to join. So I did.<br />
The first stop (for me, and also the last) was at the Amtrak station. Yes, there is an actual operating Amtrak station in this museum. Apparently, the rail travel still has to go through here. Kinda neat, eh?<br />
Once upon a time, it used to be the Men&#8217;s Waiting Room. (There was also a Women&#8217;s Waiting Room.) It featured a lounge, showers (baths for women), smoking room &#8212; everything you needed to freshen up (or wait) for your train. Today, the women&#8217;s room is gone &#8212; it&#8217;s now storage, the showers have been taken out and the door removed, and the decor is plastic overlay instead of wood. But it still features the original flooring and art deco lights.<br />
When we exited the room, the line-up for the movie had grown considerably. I opted to not follow the rest, as I wanted a good seat (this is crucial in an IMAX film).<br />
The movie was &#8220;Amazon&#8221;, and is perhaps one of the better IMAX movies I&#8217;ve seen. It tells the story of how two completely different civilizations (Western, and of the many that live in and around the Amazon basin) look to the Amazon with the same purpose in mind &#8212; saving lives. It didn&#8217;t preach heavily, but it didn&#8217;t really have to &#8212; the need to preserve the Amazon was quite clear. It was the first IMAX movie I&#8217;ve seen that made me queasy. Of course, that might have been due to lack of food.<br />
After lunch, I caved in a bought a disposable camera. I wanted a pictures of the building &#8212; it&#8217;s too nice not to take pictures. Besides, I want to scan them and put them up for all to see.<br />
Afterwards, I went through the Natural History wing. Not nearly as interesting as the Cincinnati Museum, but then again, I knew most of this. They had a few things that I didn&#8217;t expect to see &#8212; a mock-up of a cave (similar to Mammoth Cave, about three hours from here), and a mock-up of a glacier (which according to the museum, stopped just short of here during the last ice age).<br />
The animals that lived here during that time were fascinating. I had never seen a skeleton, let alone a recreation, of a giant beaver. About three times the size of a normal beaver, this beastie could probably have taken down entire trees with a single bite. Big, sharp, pointy teeth.<br />
I left around 5:45, heading back towards downtown. This time I went down Ezzard Charles Drive to Central Parkway, before heading south. I went all the way down to 3rd Street, where I walked over to the John A. Roebling bridge. (One of the weird conditions about building the bridge was that it was not allowed to be in line with any existing Cincinnati streets).<br />
I walked towards the bridge until I got to a staircase that allowed me to get down to the Ohio River. From there, I got a good enough angle to take pictures of the bridge. I returned to the bridge to take a picture from its deck.<br />
Returning to Fountain Square, I partook in a late dinner at the Rock Bottom Brewery again. I was relieved to finally get off my feet &#8212; I&#8217;d been walking for hours, and was quite tired at that point.<br />
Then it was back to my room, and back to work. But at least I got part of a day off.</p>

		<p>Ugh.<br />
It never fails. I get a long weekend, I get lousy weather. I had hoped to go to the Cincinnati Museum today, but the weather kept me indoors. Okay, that sounds like a really stupid statement &#8212; if I&#8217;m going to a museum, why would I care what the weather&#8217;s like?<br />
I want to walk there &#8212; I&#8217;m a little tired of taxis, and I could use the exercise. But it rained for most of the day. It didn&#8217;t clear up until later in the afternoon. A good thing, since I wanted to go out for dinner tonight.<br />
I spent the day working, fixing our client&#8217;s website. I watched movies and coded. I&#8217;m amazed at how much work I got done watching &#8220;Meet Joe Black&#8221;. You really can work for huge periods of time and not miss much in that movie. On the opposite view, I didn&#8217;t get much done during &#8220;The Highlander&#8221;.<br />
Importantly, though, I had breakthroughs. I only wish I were actually in the office to put my theories to the test. But I have to wait until Tuesday. Our client doesn&#8217;t like having strangers run amok in the offices unescorted.<br />
My first meal in Cincinnati that wasn&#8217;t a sub was at the Rock Bottom Brewery, a brew pub in Fountain Square, pretty much right across the street from the Westin. I don&#8217;t much like going to places like that on my own, but I didn&#8217;t have a lot of choice. Besides, Nancy (my project manager) more or less ordered me to get out for dinner at least one night this weekend.<br />
Tomorrow &#8212; more rain. Hence, more work. But Monday&#8217;s supposed to be nice. If I get enough done, I&#8217;ll make an effort to get out and see what I can find. Besides, I&#8217;ll need the air by that point&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another day, another hotel. Owing to some strange reason, there seem to be a lot of people coming to Cincinnati. Can&#8217;t really figure out why.<br />
The Omni was completely booked for today when my room was booked on Tuesday. So I moved the next block over to the Westin. Larger room, better bed. Lousier TV selection, though. Oh well, I guess there are trade offs&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m definitely here for the long run. Probably won&#8217;t be escaping this place until Wednesday at the earliest. We&#8217;ve got problems that really have no explanation. Rather annoying, if you ask me. Today was about as effective as Wednesday and Thursday. This weekend is all mine, though. I&#8217;m going to rebuild parts of the site that the contractors did a number on. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t blame them &#8212; completely, anyway &#8212; they did what they had to do. Unfortunately, they aren&#8217;t the best coders in the world when it comes to HTML.<br />
My task this weekend is to correct all the mistakes. Not just theirs, but ours. We (Critical Mass) sent a few files that had a few discrepancies in style. Not a good thing. So I&#8217;m going to spend a lot of time going through every file in the site. There&#8217;s a few, but luckily, not a lot. If I had to do this for, say, the Mercedes Benz site, I&#8217;d be spending the better part of a month doing that.<br />
After work, I took the time to wander through part of downtown Cincinnati. It&#8217;s an interesting city, if only for its idiosyncracities. Its architecture is &#8230; well &#8230; interesting. (Seeing as the city&#8217;s &#8220;interesting&#8221;, I guess that goes hand-in-hand.) The buildings in downtown Cincinnati have more variance in styles than any city I&#8217;ve lived in. This is probably because Cincinnati&#8217;s been around a while, and gone through a lot of changes.<br />
The town of Losantisville was founded in 1788 on the shores of the Ohio River. Two years later, Northwest Territory Commander General Arthur St. Clair renamed the town Cincinnati, in honour of the Society of Cincinnati, an officers&#8217; organization from the Revolutionary War.<br />
Cincinnati&#8217;s location is the nexus of Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. This made it a central location for commerce, which naturally attracted people. The mid-1800s saw Cincinnati&#8217;s population grow by 40 percent as a flood newcomers, mostly German immigrants. Steamboat trade and the explosion of the pork-packing industry led to Cincinnati&#8217;s role as the &#8220;Queen City of the West&#8221;. For a time, it was the nation&#8217;s sixth largest city and third-largest manufacturing centre.<br />
Today, the industry that built Cincinnati is gone. In its place are Fortune 500 companies and a lot of smaller companies. The massive factories are gone, or subdivided by smaller companies. The downtown core is completely commercial, which explains its death in the evenings (and my boredom).<br />
Because of Cincinnati&#8217;s past, it has a very interesting present &#8230; at least from an architectural perspective. Most of the buildings downtown are either modern (built within the past 20 years), or from the 1920s to 1940s. There are a few edifices from the 50s, 60s, and 70s &#8212; they&#8217;re not too hard to spot. (Although the Federal Reserve, built in 1972, is quite nice.) Old buildings are well preserved, and easy to find.<br />
Not easy to find are Cincinnati&#8217;s mistakes, and they&#8217;ve made a couple biggies. One of the more interesting ones is Cincinnati&#8217;s attempt at a subway system. The City made the attempt, starting in the 1920s using leftovers from a canal system. A large portion of the system was completed before the Depression brought the project to a screeching halt. Lack of funds and a general trend towards automobile traffic eventually led the subway into abandonment. The tunnels are used for storage, the half-built stations boarded up. Today, hardly anything exists.<br />
Tomorrow, I intend to check out the Cincinnati Museum, an old art deco railway station converted into a museum. But that&#8217;s just part of the day &#8212; the rest will be work.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m trapped. Metaphorically speaking, that is.<br />
Today, I effectively did nothing. I spent the day trying to solve problems, but not really accomplishing anything. I started off with a conference call with Critical Mass and a few representatives of our client. We were reviewing the situation I&#8217;ve been dealing with since I arrived.<br />
The meeting wasn&#8217;t too long, and afterwards I felt that those involved had a clearer picture of the situation. This was important from my perspective, since I wasn&#8217;t too sure whether my superiors were wholly confident on sending me down in the first place. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I&#8217;m not trying to blow smoke. But considering my lack of progress, I had to make sure that the others understood that I know what I&#8217;m doing &#8230; sort of.<br />
My major problem is that there&#8217;s nothing I can do directly &#8212; I have to ask others to do it. And if those others aren&#8217;t interested in helping me, well, then I look like a bit of a putz. Not much I can do about it, I&#8217;m afraid.<br />
I struggled through the day, doing what I can, until conference call #2 in the afternoon. Same client, different project. This is the one I started on my second day at Critical Mass. It just so happened that I happened to be in Cincinnati when they needed someone. Convenient, non?<br />
Tomorrow&#8217;s the start of the long weekend here. It basically means that not much work will be done. And considering the past two days of relative inactivity, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m making it out on Sunday. Not unless all the problems disappear tomorrow, and there&#8217;s a chance I can get in on the weekend. I know snowballs that have better chances than that&#8230;<br />
After work here is dull without something to do. I&#8217;ve spent the past couple of hours watching TV. Luckily for me, I get TBS &#8212; I&#8217;ve never seen Enter The Dragon all the way through. First time for everything, I guess. After this is Rumble In The Bronx with Jackie Chan. I suppose Cincinnati isn&#8217;t so bad.<br />
If you can stay in your hotel room all the time, that is.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My alarm went off early this morning. I rose somewhat slowly (I hadn&#8217;t quite adjusted to the time zone), but eventually found my way into the shower. That woke me up enough to get dressed, shave, and prepare my notes for this morning.<br />
First stop was breakfast. Continental was served in the spacious (and opulent) dining area on the lobby floor. I found out shortly thereafter that I&#8217;d be far better off not eating &#8212; at nearly $18, I was quite relieved to know that I could expense it.<br />
I returned quickly to my room to call Corey, my contact at the client site. Corey works for the backend consultant, and would be one of the people I would be working with. I dug out his number and dialled his mobile phone. He asked that I call back &#8212; he was apparently still in transit. On the second call, he gave me directions to the building where I&#8217;d be wreaking havoc trying to fix a broken system.<br />
I&#8217;m working in a small team, all of whom have been slaving away on the installation since February. I feel sorry for them &#8212; given the amount of frustration I felt today alone, I can understand why they don&#8217;t smile a lot.<br />
It took most of the day before I began to understand what was going on. It wasn&#8217;t anything that we (Critical Mass) had done with our code. Nor was it anything that the consultants had done. It was, or at least seemed to be, the server. The software we needed didn&#8217;t appear to be correct. Simple HTML codes were being garbled.<br />
So, problem solved and I get to go home, right? Not quite. There&#8217;s a lot of things that are still unresolved &#8212; most notably the issue of whether or not the server is actually the problem. We don&#8217;t know. I came to that conclusion based on results we were getting from the server and my knowledge of how these things (usually) work. The consultants liked my answer, mostly because they were having so many problems, my hypothesis would explain a large part of it. However, I have yet to put it through the scientific process.<br />
After work, I trudged my way back to the hotel. It was hot. It was humid. I&#8217;d forgotten what it was like &#8212; I&#8217;ve been gone from the East for so long, the sudden rise in temperature (and subsequent decrease in comfort) was a little surprising.<br />
What wasn&#8217;t surprising was the city. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but Cincinnati feels and smells like &#8230; well, an American city. It&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s the same acrid diesel-infused stench (thankfully not strong) of an industrial city. Which is odd, since Cincinnati isn&#8217;t quite as industrial as it used to be.<br />
Returning to my room, I quickly changed into shorts, and proceeded to figure out what I would do. The answer was quick (and somewhat obvious, at least to those who know me) &#8212; a movie. Specifically, Mission: Impossible 2. (Critical Mass *had* to send me in opening week&#8230;) The hard part was finding a place that actually had the movie.<br />
There are no movie theatres in downtown Cincinnati. I don&#8217;t know why. Makes no sense. The nearest theatre is five miles away &#8230; straight-line distance. It&#8217;s about 10 miles, once you count in all the turns and zigzags. It costs about US$14. So why did I bother? Well, simply put, there ain&#8217;t a heck of a lot to do in downtown Cincinnati.<br />
The taxi driver had no idea where the Showcase Cinema was. I only knew that it was off of Route 562. The driver took off in that direction, while I attempted to narrow down the search. The major problem was that we had no real address, and for the second time since I got here, my cell phone didn&#8217;t want to dial. (A note for you Clearnet users &#8212; it has problems roaming in the States.)<br />
We headed up I-71, looking for the turn-off onto Route 562. The driver&#8217;s instinct took over and he left the highway shortly after turning onto Route 562, into a subdivision. We pulled into a BP station, where he quickly got directions. A scarce five minutes later, we arrived at the Showcase Cinemas.<br />
It was worth it, at least in my opinion. Certainly better than watching TV in my suite all night. And yes, the taxi was expensive, but since I ate about US$5 of food today, and will probably do same tomorrow, it&#8217;ll all eventually balance out.<br />
I hope&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a long day.<br />
It all started about a week ago. One of our clients, whom I&#8217;m afraid I cannot mention, had a problem with the website we developed for them. Actually, it wasn&#8217;t the client so much as it was our so-called partner in crime.<br />
Critical Mass typically designs the front-end &#8212; all the pretty pictures and clicky things &#8212; of a website. Typically, someone else does the back-end &#8212; all the junk that deals with the ecommerce and database. This isn&#8217;t our idea &#8212; it&#8217;s usually the client&#8217;s. We don&#8217;t much cotton to that process; it lends to more problems than it&#8217;s worth. That&#8217;s how I ended up here in Cincinnati.<br />
We provided one of our stunning works of art to the client, who then turned it over to the backend developers (whom, again, I cannot mention). The firm is large, and we assumed technically savvy. We should know better.<br />
They fubared the site. Lemme back up &#8212; they tried to merge our site with their backend, and then claimed that our &#8220;monkey s&#8211;t JavaScript&#8221; didn&#8217;t work. That&#8217;s a load of bally-hoo &#8212; we wouldn&#8217;t have shipped it if it didn&#8217;t work. Then we got the email that drove most of us in Web Development off the deep end&#8230;<br />
We develop our sites with the most recent developments in HTML, including JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). One of our favourite tricks is to build everything in &#8220;layers&#8221; &#8212; small pieces we can stack on top of each other. It makes the site very flexible. This technique is what was causing the backend consultants grief.<br />
The backend (using a system called Dynamo) wasn&#8217;t working with our layers (specifically, a tag called a &#8220;DIV&#8221;). So they decided that we could no longer develop using DIV tags, and had to build everything with tables. Uhhhhh, no.<br />
We thought this was a load of crock from the moment we first heard it. We knew that our code was solid &#8212; we&#8217;d built several sites using Dynamo and DIVs, and never had a problem. So we told them that. They didn&#8217;t exactly listen. I wrote up a small quasi-manifesto (with some contributions from Adile, my partner in crime in my first project at Critical Mass). I figure that&#8217;s how I ended up here.<br />
On Friday, just after lunch, Nancy (the account manager for this particular client) drew me aside and asked if I would go to Cincinnati and clear this mess up. Big responsibility. No, I wasn&#8217;t the best choice &#8212; there are others in the company who were far better suited to this problem &#8212; but I was the best choice of the available people.<br />
Simply put, there were about five people Nancy would have sent. Two were far too tied up on projects to pull off. One was, well, we were worried that they would back down and give into the consultant&#8217;s demands to convert the entire site to tables. Another would have been ideal, but would probably get into too many arguments to be truly effective. That left me. Being between projects, and having some experience with Dynamo and DIVs, I got fingered to go.<br />
This morning, I was running around like a madman, trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible. The flight still hadn&#8217;t been booked (nor the hotel), I hadn&#8217;t packed (owing to a lack of a suitably-sized duffel bag), I needed to set up email forwarding, get files copied to the laptop (which had only just returned from Cincinnati), I had to square away rent (just in case I don&#8217;t get back before the beginning of the month), and I had to pay a couple of bills. All that before 11:00.<br />
I left at 11:40 for the airport. The flight was at 2:05 on Northwest Airlines. I would fly from Calgary to Minneapolis/St. Paul, where I&#8217;d catch a connecting flight to Cincinnati. (Oh the joys of the airline hub.) I arrived at Calgary airport in sufficient time to check-in and get lunch.<br />
I&#8217;ve never flown Northwest before. I don&#8217;t like American airlines in general, and I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having to take one. But when given no choice, you take what you&#8217;re given. That&#8217;s why when I found out that my ticket automatically upgraded me to First Class, I didn&#8217;t refuse.<br />
I didn&#8217;t check any bags &#8212; I prefer not to, just so I don&#8217;t have to deal with baggage pick-up at the other end. Customs was fun. The game was &#8220;Let&#8217;s See If We Can Freak Geoff Out&#8221;. The questions came fast and hard, and I responded just as quickly. Then I goofed. When asked for the duration of my stay, I said I hoped to return on Sunday. &#8220;Hoped.&#8221; Bad choice of word. This brought up a whole issue of why I wouldn&#8217;t be coming back on Sunday. That escalated into the purpose of my visit, and what exactly was I doing there. I figured it would snowball into &#8220;Why can&#8217;t an American do this?&#8221; &#8212; luckily, it didn&#8217;t.<br />
The flight was late, by about 30 minutes or so. Soon we were called, and I walked down the gangway to our DC-9. I can&#8217;t tell you the last time I&#8217;d flown in a DC-9, only that it&#8217;s been a very long time. I had 3C, and the adjoining 3A, all to myself. Wow. Big seats. Nice service. Free booze. Too bad I&#8217;m trying not to drink (I get dehydrated enough as it is on planes without having alcohol).<br />
It was about three hours to Minneapolis. During the time, we were served lunch &#8212; a chicken sandwich. But in First Class, the sandwich is nice and hot, with yummy cheese and grilled peppers. It comes with a nice little salad, and an Italian rolled ice cream ball.<br />
I like First Class.<br />
You also get a GLASS glass for your drink, instead of some goofy plastic cup. It really does make a difference.<br />
We arrived in Minneapolis around 5:45pm (local time). I was supposed to go to Gate 7, where I&#8217;d catch my connecting flight at 7:00. So of course, we came in at Gate 64. Figures. I hiked across the airport (and boy, is it a big airport), and found my way to Gate 7. There, I plunked myself down, and continued to teach myself Dynamo. (Not having a manual makes it kinda hard.)<br />
Around 6:30, I began to wonder why Gate 7 didn&#8217;t have any sign up for my flight. Gate 8, which was leaving for Green Bay at 7:15, had its sign up before I got there. I started to wonder. So I asked.<br />
Attendant: &#8220;Yeah, your flight is leaving from Gate Sev&#8230; er, they&#8217;ve moved it.&#8221;<br />
Me: &#8220;Where to?&#8221; (I already knew the answer. Murphy was standing right behind me.)<br />
Attendant: &#8220;Gate 82.&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;ll tell you one thing &#8212; I&#8217;m glad that I started working out (although I&#8217;ve been a little lax in the past week or two). By the time I got to Gate 82, I was winded. Of course, I was hiking at a serious pace to get there on time.<br />
Flight 8530 was being operated by Mesaba Airlines. I haven&#8217;t heard of &#8217;em, either. Frankly, that worried me, too. But as it turns out, they just operate Northwest&#8217;s regional flights. Supposedly, Cincinnati is regional from Minneapolis.<br />
We flew an RJ-45, er, 85 (sorry, techie joke there). I&#8217;ve never heard of an RJ-85, I don&#8217;t even know who built the silly thing. It looks kind of like a cross between a Harrier Jumpjet and a 747. Very strange. Holds about 69 people. Flies like a kite &#8212; sways all over the bloody place.<br />
The meal was another sandwich &#8212; turkey, this time. No ice cream, though. We got a gourmet cookie instead. Whee. This time I had a rowmate, a guy from Cisco Systems. We engaged in hearty conversation in the last 20 minutes or so of the flight, recounting our views of Digital Equipment, and how we realized that they were doomed long before Compaq bought &#8217;em out.<br />
I&#8217;d forgotten how humid it gets out here (in the East, that is). Calgary is dry &#8212; it&#8217;s like walking through a lake out here (comparatively speaking, of course). I sweltered the entire way downtown to the Omni Netherlands.<br />
Nathan, who&#8217;d only recently returned to Calgary from here, complained that the Omni&#8217;s rooms were &#8220;small&#8221;. I could easily hold a small concert in my room. I hate to know what he thinks &#8220;big&#8221; is.<br />
Well, I&#8217;m off to bed now. I&#8217;ve got a long day tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. It&#8217;s going to be a long week&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend saw the first league tournament of the season. Frankly, I couldn&#8217;t quite figure out why we had a tournament so early in the year (we&#8217;ve had TWO regular season games so far, both on the same day). But I wasn&#8217;t about to turn down the ability to go out and get some more practice.<br />
Goodness knows I need it.<br />
Our first game was Friday evening up in the Northeast at Lester B. Pearson High School (a bare hop-skip-and-jump from my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s), against a team called the Screwballs. Oddly enough, of the three games we played this weekend, theirs is the only one whose name I remember.<br />
We almost had to forfeit due to lack of players. It wasn&#8217;t a problem of not enough women, we didn&#8217;t have enough guys. Luckily, the rest showed up just as we started the game. It was a chilly evening, so I was quite happy to play right field, where I would be at least somewhat mobile.<br />
The first inning went more-or-less uneventful &#8212; no major screwups on our part, no major offensive on their part. The second inning brought my first at bat. Memories of our first two games hung heavily with me. I was dreading another strike out. I hadn&#8217;t had the chance to get to a batting cage (and so I&#8217;ve found out since then, they ain&#8217;t cheap, so I&#8217;ll be going sparingly when I actually get around to going). I was, shall we say, apprehensive.<br />
Looking at the selection of bats, I noticed that there was a new bat. I&#8217;d tried all the previous three bats, all without success. I figured that I couldn&#8217;t possibly do any worse with the new bat.<br />
The first pitch looked good. Figuring that I was going to miss it anyway, I swung. A peculiar feeling vibrated through the bat handle a fraction of a moment later, and I found myself wondering what just happened. I looked up to see a small off-white sphere sailing away from where the bat had just been. The now-familiar &#8220;plack!&#8221; sound the ball usually made when it landed on the mat was not to be heard. Using my powerful deductive reasoning, I came to the (rather surprising) conclusion that I&#8217;d actually hit the ball.<br />
Who &#8216;da thunk it?<br />
That&#8217;s when I heard the voices. &#8220;Run!&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t my team yelling at me &#8212; it was the ones in my head. (Relax, I haven&#8217;t gone insane. I&#8217;ll explain in a moment.) I bolted to first as fast as my legs, which clearly weren&#8217;t ready for the sudden motion, could take me. There was no way I was going to make it to second, so I held tight.<br />
Needless to say, I was rather amazed with myself. Not so much that it was a good hit (it passed over the shortstop&#8217;s outstretched (with a good jump) glove by mere inches), but that I hit it at all. Little did I know what was happening to me.<br />
(I would hit every single time at bat for the rest of the weekend &#8212; only once would I not make it to base. Every time, it was with that bat &#8212; a Louisville Slugger. I love that bat.)<br />
The inning ended, sadly, with me stranded on second. Well, I was on my way to third, but the batter was caught out.<br />
Returning to right field, I began to sit back into waiting. Right field, especially in this league, is quiet. Not much happens out there. (Now that I&#8217;ve said that, I&#8217;ll be inundated with pop flies for the rest of the season.)<br />
The first batter up collided with the ball sort of like a Howitzer &#8230; into right field. (He was a lefty, it was half-expected.) Last year, I missed a lot of these shots. For some reason, I was always too short. (Short as in I wasn&#8217;t far enough out in the field.) I could see the ball arcing towards me, and all I kept thinking was: &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna miss this.&#8221;<br />
Then I heard the voices.<br />
&#8220;Take a couple steps back.&#8221;<br />
So I did. Suddenly, I realized that I was under it. I adjusted my footing so that I was right under it. Next thing I knew, the ball was in my glove. I paused a brief moment until the shock wore off. I threw the ball to the second baser, but there was no rush &#8212; there were no other runners.<br />
While I waited for the next batter, I stood there trying to figure out what the heck had just happened. I was puzzled beyond belief.<br />
You see, I&#8217;d heard the voices before. On last Monday&#8217;s games, I kept hearing things like &#8220;Run&#8221;, &#8220;Hold up&#8221;, &#8220;Bend and scoop&#8221;, and &#8220;Stab at the ball&#8221;. Yet no-one on my team was telling me these things.<br />
At first, I thought it was just me. But standing out there in right field, one gets a fair bit of time to think, reflect, self search, and wonder. In that inning, I had an epiphany. Like being broad-sided with a battleship, I abruptly realized what was happening. I didn&#8217;t have (and still don&#8217;t have) a mentor on the team. But I don&#8217;t need one &#8212; I&#8217;ve got my mentors from last year. Every word of advice they ever told me is coming back.<br />
It&#8217;s sort of like when you make a stew or chili. If you try and eat it right away, it&#8217;s okay, but not great. You have to let it sit and let all the flavours blend. During the six-plus months off, all the advice I got starting sinking in. Like someone turning a light on in a dark room, I knew where the voices were coming from.<br />
As you can guess, I was quite happy to figure this out &#8230; I was beginning to worry for a while.<br />
Now this hasn&#8217;t turned me into Sammy Sosa &#8212; but I&#8217;ve noticed that I&#8217;m playing significantly better than last year. Either that, or the team (and the league) is significantly worse than last year&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Despite my apparent improvement, we were unable to defeat our opposing team. However, we lost by only a couple of runs. This, believe it or not, is a very positive thing. It showed that despite only one practice (which I missed) and two games (one of which we one), we weren&#8217;t doing too badly.<br />
That didn&#8217;t stop us from engaging in another practice. Those of us who weren&#8217;t in a rush to take off stuck around for an impromptu ball-catching session. The voices kept telling me what to do (&#8220;Dive&#8221;, &#8220;Step Back&#8221;, &#8220;Run In&#8221;, &#8220;LOOK OUT!!&#8221;), and I kept catching the balls. It was almost like someone had me on remote control. It was actually kinda creepy.<br />
My alarm went off at 6:00 the following morning. I ignored it until the second alarm went off at 6:30. Because we&#8217;d lost the previous night, our first game was at 8:00 at the Deerfoot Athletic Park at Deerfoot and 16th Ave NW.<br />
One look out the window told me what it wasn&#8217;t going to be a warm day. It looked cold. There was no reason for me to think that, but it looked cold. Sure enough, a check of the thermometer (on TV) told me that it was cold &#8212; it was definitely a morning for sweats.<br />
I arrived at the field not long after Ken, our coach. We found our field, and started to wait for the rest of the team. They slowly started accumulating after a little while, the rest of us shivering in the cold. When the equipment finally arrived, several of us immediately began warming up.<br />
The sun poked into the field about 20 minutes after we started, and as the right fielder, I was in a prime position to take its full warmth. Even then, I was still cold. It wasn&#8217;t until after a couple of innings that I was warm enough to even unzip the collar on my sweatshirt.<br />
The game was tough and tight &#8212; we were about evenly matched. Except that we were one player short. We need 10 people on a team (the tenth person is a &#8220;rover&#8221;, someone who can run throughout the outfield, supporting the other fielders). We had only nine. This meant we had to take an automatic out every rotation of the batting order. It was a shortage that would cost us dearly.<br />
Tight as the game was, we came up two runs short. And no, the final score wasn&#8217;t 2-0. It was 10-8. That&#8217;s how well we played. Hearing voices in my head was becoming a handy thing to have.<br />
Our next game wasn&#8217;t until 12:30, so I opted to head downtown and do some work. Not real work, of course, but something for fun. I&#8217;m developing a website for a good friend of mine, who has a very cool product. It gets launched next Monday &#8212; maybe I&#8217;ll let you know! I was a little behind on my work on that, so I figured I&#8217;d make use of the downtime and start plugging away.<br />
As I wrote HTML and tweaked images, I could see the bright sunshine outside. I figured our next game would be nice, and I could finally strip down to my shorts. I should know better than that&#8230;<br />
When I got back to Deerfoot Athletic Park, the sky was cloudy, the wind blowing harder, and it seemed even colder than in the morning. I was the first to arrive, and I watched as two teams battled for the chance to play again later in the day.<br />
Our team assembled, even with a couple of spares for a change, and prepared to take the field. I took right field, as usual, and started freezing to death. It wasn&#8217;t much above zero (as was fully shown when it snowed in the fourth inning).<br />
In fact, it was so cold the voices shivered. Luckily, I was still able to play reasonably well. But even if we had all played in top-notch form, we could not have held back the onslaught. We were outmatched, and it wasn&#8217;t by a small margin. Final score: 22-8.<br />
Losing by that much when you play poorly isn&#8217;t such a bad loss &#8212; you kind of expect it. Losing by that much when you put everything you have into the game is just downright demoralizing.<br />
Tonight, we&#8217;re back at the game for another doubleheader. (All our play dates this year are doubleheaders, for some stupid reason.) My shin is still a little stiff from Saturday, but with luck I&#8217;ll be able to play.<br />
Just so long as I have the voices to keep me company in right field.</p>
